     The tumor cells are negative for any membranous staining with either
     antibody, indicating lack of over-expression of the HER2/neu
     oncoprotein.   Parallel controls were run with the test case and were
     adequate.

 Final Diagnosis
 
 Right breast tissue: FATTY TISSUE AND FOCAL DUCT PAPILLOMATOSIS
 WITHOUT ATYPIA, please see comment
 
 COMMENT: This lumpectomy has been completely examined in 52 blocks.
 Ninety percent of the lump is formed by mature adipose tissue with
 delicate vascular fibrous septae. Scattered throughout the lump are
 dense fibrous septae of 1-2 mm thickness surrounding dermal ducts or
 small atrophic breast lobules. In the middle part of this specimen in
 block 20 there is a small duct papilloma and another focus of mild
 ductal hyperplasia without atypia in the lateral end of the lump
 (block 44). Vessels of variable size are scattered throughout the
 lesion as one would expect to see in normal breast. Some are present
 around the terminal ducts or small ascinar lobules present as part of
 the neurovascular bundles. Occasionally small clusters of blood
 vessels are present within the fat but these are not associated with
 any breast parenchyma. The enhanced nodule seen on the mammographic
 examination of this specimen is a lobule of adipose tissue surrounded
 by thin fibrous septae.
 
 In summary, complete examination of this specimen in 52 blocks reveals
 mostly adipose tissue with its fibrovascular components and a very
 small duct papilloma as a focus of mild ductal hyperplasia without
 atypia.

 Addendum Diagnosis
 In the area of radial scar, angulated tubular structures were seen.
 Myosin SM and p63 were performed to exclude tubular carcinoma arising
 in radial scar. Both immunohistochemical stains were positive for
 myoepithelial cells, supporting the interpretation of radial scar. No
 carcinoma identified in the specimen. The diagnosis is finalized.

     seen associated with the invasive component.
     The second biopsy (site B) shows predominantly in-situ carcinoma with
     solid and cribriform patterns, intermediate nuclear grade and comedo
     necrosis.  There is sclerosing adenosis and this shows cancerization
     of lobules.  There is also a focus of microinvasion.  Given that this

ALH. Family history of breast cancer. 2 previous biopsies,
including ultrasound guided an MRI guided for an MRI detected
right breast lesion (January and April, 2008), both benign. No
longer on HRT (according to patient history).
","The Primary Accession Number : 4956100. The Associated Accession Number : 4965250^4968103^,
The procedure was explained to the patient. Routine cleaning and
2% xylocaine local anesthesia was performed. Under ultrasound
guidance the clip was identified in the right inferior breast at 6
o'clock. Approximately 2cm lateral to the clip there was a 0.6cm
hypoechoic ill defined lesion that could correlate to the MR mass.
Skin above this lesion was marked with an X.

A 7cm needle was directed through the lesion and to the clip under
ultrasound guidance. Hook wire was left in place. Post
localization mammograms were performed to confirm position of the
wire.
IMPRESSION:
Uneventful ultrasound wire localization of lesion in the upper
outer quadrant of the left breast.

ADDENDUM: The specimen was brought to the breast imaging
department. Ultrasound of the specimen demonstrated the
hypoechoic lesion seen on today's ultrasound, however no clip was
visualized within specimen. Mammogram was performed of the
specimen, which failed to demonstrate the clip. I called Dr. Quan
in the OR to inform her, and suggested resected deeper towards the
chest wall, where the clip had been lying preoperatively. Second
specimen was sent and mammogram repeated, no clip was found. We
then received a call that Dr. Quan had felt and removed the clip
in the OR. Both specimens received by breast imaging were sent to
pathology.

Addendum # 1 by Bonnie O'Hayon on 2009-May-19 1606

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY: PROLIFERATIVE FIBROCYSTIC CHANGE and FOCAL
ATYPICAL LOBULAR HYPERPLASIA found in the lumpectomy specimen, no
evidence of malignancy.

The previously described MR mass could be concordant with the
above pathology diagnosis. If ongoing conservative
management/surveillance is planned, then suggest follow up MRI in
3 months to re-evaluate right breast. This case has been
discussed with Dr. Causer.

     COMMENT:
     Sections show an invasive duct carcinoma of the breast that focally
     shows an invasive micropapillary pattern.  The tumour has intermediate
     grade nuclei.  It grows in small nests without tubule formation.
     Invasive tumour necrosis is absent.  At least one focus is suspicious
     for lymphovascular invasion.  Microcalcifications are identified in
     the stroma adjacent to the invasive carcinoma.
     There is a small component of in-situ duct carcinoma; solid and

     COMMENT:
     The left breast lumpectomy specimen was serially sectioned in 10
     slices.  Microscopic evaluation demonstrates two foci of atypical
     ductal hyperplasia.
     The first of these foci is in blocks A11 and A12 and shows columnar
     cell change with atypia as well as atypical ductal hyperplasia within
     an area of adenosis.
     The second focus is in blocks 23 and 24; here 2 ducts have the
     organization and structure of in-situ duct carcinoma, however, they
     measure less than 1 mm each and thus the criteria for in-situ
     carcinoma is not met quantitatively.  The surrounding tissue shows
     flat epithelial atypia.  This second focus will be tested for hormone
     receptors, should hormonal prophylaxis be considered for this patient.

     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast wire localized lumpectomy, short superior, long lateral'. The
     accompanying requisition matches the container' s label.  Specimen
     consists of a wire localized left breast lumpectomy which is oriented
     with a short suture marking superior and a long suture marking the
     lateral.  It measures 6 cm SI by 9 cm ML by 3.8 cm AP.  Three
     localizing wires are seen protruding from the anterior lateral aspect.
     The resection margin is painted as follows: Green ink on the superior
     one third, blue ink on the inferior one third and red ink on the mid
     one third.  On serial section through the specimen it is predominantly
     fatty with scattered glandular areas.  Centrally there is dense
     fibroglandular tissue.  No masses are noted.  Specimen x-ray reveals
     scattered microcalcifications.  Representative sections of the
     specimen are submitted as follows:

     margin.  It measures 8 cm ML by 3.5 cm SI by 1.3 cm AP.  The new
     posterior margin as indicated by the suture is painted with black ink.
     On serial section the cut surface is predominantly fatty with
     scattered fibrous areas.  There are no abnormalities of note.  The
     specimen is serially sectioned and submitted in its entirety from
     medial to lateral in blocks one through 12.

     Margins for the two foci of atypical ductal hyperplasia are as
     follows:
     The closest margin to the first focus (blocks 11 and 12) is the
     anterior at 1.4 cm (14 mm) away.  All other resection margins are also
     greater than 1 cm away from this focus.
     The second focus (blocks 23 and 24) is at 1 cm from the
     inferior-posterior margin.  All other resection margins are greater
     than 1 cm away from this focus.

     Core biopsy, right breast:
     
     - INVASIVE CARCINOMA WITH LOBULAR FEATURES
     - NEGATIVE FOR HER2/NEU GENE AMPLIFICATION
     
     COMMENT:
     Testing for the Her2/neu status on core B was done using
     immunohistochemistry and the Ventana rabbit monoclonal antibody 4B5.
     The staining was patchy and could not be interpreted and thus was
     considered equivocal.  Re-testing using silver in situ hybridization
     and the Ventana kit was done.  The tumour cells are mostly diploid
     with 2 and rare 3 signals of chromosome 17.  There is very low
     aneuploidy of the Her2/neu gene with signals varying from 2 to 4.  The
     average signal for the Her2/neu gene per cell is 2.6 and 2.3 for
     chromosome 17.  Thus, the SISH score is 1.1, indicating no evidence of
     amplification of the Her2/neu gene in this tumour.
     
     HER2/neu Gene Amplification; Silver In Situ Hybridization (SISH):
     
     
     Number of nuclei examined = 40
     Number of observers = 2
     Average HER2 signals per nucleus = 2.6
     Average CEP17 signals per nucleus = 2.3
     Ratio HER2/CEP17 = 1.1
     
     
     Interpretation Criteria-SISH
     
     Result Category          SISH score / HER2 gene amplification

     HER2/neu Oncoprotein Overexpression Immunohistochemistry:
     Representative sections of this tumor were stained with the monoclonal
     antibody 4B5 (rabbit) monoclonal (Ventana) raised against the HER2/neu
     oncoprotein. The tumor cells show equivocal membranous staining,
     therefore further testing using in-situ hybridization will be done and
     an addendum report will follow. Parallel controls were run with the
     test case and were adequate.

     Core biopsy, right breast:
     
     - INVASIVE CARCINOMA WITH LOBULAR FEATURES
     - NEGATIVE FOR HER2/NEU GENE AMPLIFICATION
     
     COMMENT:
     Testing for the Her2/neu status on core B was done using
     immunohistochemistry and the Ventana rabbit monoclonal antibody 4B5.
     The staining was patchy and could not be interpreted and thus was
     considered equivocal.  Re-testing using silver in situ hybridization
     and the Ventana kit was done.  The tumour cells are mostly diploid
     with 2 and rare 3 signals of chromosome 17.  There is very low
     aneuploidy of the Her2/neu gene with signals varying from 2 to 4.  The
     average signal for the Her2/neu gene per cell is 2.6 and 2.3 for
     chromosome 17.  Thus, the SISH score is 1.1, indicating no evidence of
     amplification of the Her2/neu gene in this tumour.
     
     HER2/neu Gene Amplification; Silver In Situ Hybridization (SISH):
     
     
     Number of nuclei examined = 40
     Number of observers = 2
     Average HER2 signals per nucleus = 2.6
     Average CEP17 signals per nucleus = 2.3
     Ratio HER2/CEP17 = 1.1
     
     
     Interpretation Criteria-SISH
     
     Result Category          SISH score / HER2 gene amplification
     
     Positive               HER2/CEP17 ratio greater than 2.2
     
     Equivocal          HER2/CEP17 ratio 1.8  2.2
     
     Negative          HER2/CEP17 ratio less than 1.8

     eligible for adjuvant trastuzumab trials

 SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
 Right breast biopsy (MRI VAC) - 9G x10 cores
 
 
 
 DIAGNOSIS
 Right breast, core biopsy:
 ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA
 
 COMMENT:
 Sections show breast parenchyma with several foci of columnar cell
 hyperplasia. In a few areas the architecture of the epithelium
 becomes complex and somewhat, but not completely cribriform. There is
 some nuclear atypia. The lesion does not meet the criteria for
 in-situ carcinoma. The surrounding breast tissue shows sclerosing
 adenosis with dystrophic calcifications.
 
 
 
 
 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
 breast biopsy samples MRI VAC'. The accompanying requisition matches
 the container' s label. The specimen consists of multiple cores and
 fragments of tan fatty tissue measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm in
 aggregate. Submitted in toto in 3 blocks.

     COMMENT
     The core biopsy of the left breast show a large core of invasive duct
     carcinoma and 3 small fragments of invasive duct carcinoma. Most of
     the tumor is negative for Her 2 Neu oncoprotein and Her2 Neu gene
     amplification. However there is one fragment of about 2mm showing
     positive Her 2 Neu overexpressionscore3+ and Her2 Neu gene
     amplification score 6. This heterogenous pattern of expression can
     occur but is relatively rare. Since this is only a core biopsy the
     extent of the positive and negative Her2 Neu status in the whole tumor
     need to be assessed on the surgical excision specimen.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION
     Right  suspicious for LABC, receptotrs and HER 2 Neu please.
     Left  suspicious mass.
     
     SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
     A: right breast samples
     B: left breast samples
     
     
     
     DIAGNOSIS
     A.  Right breast, core biopsy:
     INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST
     
     B.  Left breast, core biopsy:
     SCLEROSING ADENOSIS
     
     COMMENT:
     Sections of the right breast core biopsy show an intermediate grade
     invasive duct carcinoma, not otherwise specified.  There is a
     component of in-situ carcinoma, solid and cribriform type with a few
     foci of comedo necrosis.  Invasive tumour necrosis and lymphovascular
     invasion are not seen in the sections examined.  Calcifications are
     present in the invasive tumour.  Receptor studies have been ordered
     and will be reported in an addendum.
     
     Sections of the left core biopsy show a tightly packed area of
     sclerosing adenosis forming a mass-like lesion.  There is no atypia in
     the sections examined.
     
     
     
     
     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast samples'. The accompanying requisition matches the container' s
     label.  The specimen consists of 4 of fibrofatty tissue.  Each core
     has a diameter of 0.3-cm.  The cores range in length from 0.6 to
     1.1-cm.  The specimen is submitted in total in 1 block.
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast samples'. The accompanying requisition matches the container' s
     label.  The specimen consists of 5 cores of fibrofatty tissue.  Each
     core has a diameter of 0.3-cm.  The cores range in length from 0.6 to
     1.4-cm.  The specimen is submitted in total in 1 block.

 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
 
 Patient Name: LUMLEY, HEATHER ANNA
 HFN: 957564
 Encounter #: 3343408S
 Specimen #: S09-8189
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION
 Pre-op diagnosis: duct papilloma.
 
 SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
 Left breast needle loc lumpectomy (specimen to mammography)
 
 
 
 DIAGNOSIS
 Left breast, lumpectomy:
 LARGE BENIGN INTRADUCT PAPILLOMA SEE COMMENT
 
 COMMENT:
 Sections show a large complex intraduct papilloma. Within the
 papilloma there is florid hyperplasia, apocrine changes and areas of
 sclerosis. There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy. The lesion
 appears completely excised.
 
 
 
 
 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
 breast lumpectomy needle localization'. The accompanying requisition
 matches the container' s label. Specimen consists of a left breast
 lumpectomy which is wire localized (x 1) and oriented with a long
 suture presumed to be lateral and a short suture presumed to be
 superior. The wire localizer is seen protruding from the anterior
 aspect. The specimen measures 2.8 cm SI by 6 cm ML by 3 cm AP. The
 resection margins are painted as follows: Green ink on the superior
 one third, blue ink on the inferior one third and red ink on the mid
 one third. The posterior resection margin is repainted with black
 dye. On serial section corresponding to the hook of the localizer
 wire is a well circumscribed mass measuring 0.3 cm in diameter. It
 has a solid white cut surface and extends to within 2 cm of the
 superior margin, 0.6 cm of the inferior margin, to within less than
 0.1 cm of the posterior margin, 1.2 cm of the anterior margin, 3.5 cm
 of the lateral margin and 2 cm of the medial margin. The tissue
 surrounding the mass is composed of dense fibrous tissue. On
 examination of the remainder of the specimen it is predominantly fatty
 with scattered glandular areas. No other masses or abnormalities are

     duct with carcinoma in situ.  Small clusters of single cells present
     in a dense lymphocytic infiltrate that are highly suspicious for
     invasion.  Also, small fragments of single malignant cells mixed with
     hemorrhage and necrotic fragments are present loose, however these are
     not associated with stroma to assess the presence of invasion in these
     areas.

     Comment:
     A. Sections show low grade invasive lobular carcinoma arranged in
     single files. E-cadherin immunostaining is negative confirming the
     lobular histogenesis. There is no in situ carcinoma. There is no
     evidence of lymphovascular invasion.
     
     B. Sections show breast tissue with usual ductal hyperplasia.
     Immunohistochemical staining with CK 5/6 highlights the intraductal
     proliferation of cells supporting the diagnosis of usual ductal
     hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy.

     DIAGNOSIS
     Right breast core biopsy:
     INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, NOS.
     
     COMMENT:
     A. The core biopsy shows the presence of well differentiated invasive
     ductal carcinoma NOS. Some tumour cells have a lobular pattern of
     infiltration. The tumour cells show membranous positivity for
     E-cadherin which is supportive of ductal origin. In situ ductal
     carcinoma of the solid subtype is present. The nuclear grade of the
     DCIS is 1/3. No evidence of lymphovascular invasion is noted in the
     sections examined.

     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast lump sutures long patch lateral, short superior'. The
     accompanying requisition matches the container' s label.
     
     Specimen consists of an oriented right lumpectomy specimen with a long
     suture on the lateral margin and a short suture on the superior
     margin, as per the requisition.  Specimen measures 8.3-cm ML by 6.3-cm
     SI by 5.0 cm AP.  The superior one third of the surgical margin is
     painted with green dye, the middle one third with red dye and the
     inferior one third with blue dye.  For additional orientation
     purposes, black dye will be applied to the posterior surface of the
     specimen.  The specimen contains a central cyst measuring 4.4-cm ML by
     3.5-cm SI by up to 1.5-cm AP.  The cyst is closest to the anterior
     surgical margin and shows a transmural defect that measures 0.3-cm in
     diameter.  The specimen is composed of fibrofatty tissue,
     predominantly dense fibrocystic tissue surrounding the central cyst.
     The contents of the central cyst are unknown.  The cyst is partially
     lined with tan/brown papillary tissue mixed with red/brown hemorrhagic
     material.  The approximate surgical margins for this cyst are as
     follows: Lateral -- 1 .0 cm, medial -- 1.5 cm, superior -- 2 .0 cm,
     inferior -- 1 .0 cm, posterior -- 0.3-cm and anterior -- less than
     0.1-cm. representative sections are submitted as follows:

     Specimen consists of an irregularly shaped piece of fibrofatty tissue
     with a suture marking the new medial/inferior margin [painted with
     black dye].  The specimen measures 1.8 x 1.2 x 1 .0 cm [suture to
     opposite side].  The specimen is composed of fibrofatty tissue with
     one edge containing fat necrosis and possible cautery artifact.  The
     specimen is serially sectioned and submitted on edge in blocks 1
     through 3.

     HER2/neu Oncoprotein Overexpression Immunohistochemistry:
     
     We were asked to review our immunohistochemistry slide by Dr. C.
     Simmons.
     On review, it appears that the tumor cells show strong cytoplasmic
     staining for the HER2/neu oncoprotein thus the assessment of actual
     membranous labeling is compromised.  Therefore the tumor is equivocal
     for HER2/neu oncoprotein overexpression, corresponds to 2+ positivity.
     The case will be further studied using in situ hybridization
     technique. Parallel positive controls were run with the test and were
     adequate.

     Sections show a well differentiated invasive duct carcinoma where most
     if not all of the tumour grows in tubules and nuclear grade is low.
     This may represent a tubular carcinoma, but this is best established
     on an excision specimen.  Invasive tumour necrosis and lymphovascular
     invasion are not seen.  Receptor studies will be reported in an
     addendum.

     Representative sections of this tumor were stained with the monoclonal
     antibody 4B5 (rabbit) monoclonal (Ventana) raised against the HER2/neu
     oncoprotein. The tumor cells show equivocal membranous staining (2+),
     therefore further testing using in-situ hybridization will be done and
     an addendum report will follow. Parallel controls were run with the

 Patient Name: TSAI, NEEVEEN J
 HFN: 2670287
 Encounter #: 1429410R
 Specimen #: S10-13711
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION
 12H extensive suspicious mass. 3H small suspicious mass.
 
 SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
 A: Right breast biopsy, 3H
 B: Right breast biopsy, 12H
 
 
 
 DIAGNOSIS
 A. Right breast (3H), core biopsy:
 INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST
 
 B. Right breast (12H), core biopsy:
 INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST
 
 COMMENT:
 The two biopsies show an invasive duct carcinoma of the breast, not
 otherwise specified, whose appearance is similar. Both appear to be
 approx. intermediate grade lesions. The second lesion (12H) is
 associated with numerous calcifications. Invasive tumour necrosis and
 lymphovascular invasion are not seen in the sections examined.
 
 
 
 
 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
 breast biopsies siteA, 3-H'. The accompanying requisition matches the
 container's label. The specimen consists of 4 cores of tan and fatty
 tissue, each with a diameter of 0.1 cm, ranging from 0.4 to 1.5 cm in
 length. Submitted in toto in one block.
 
 B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
 breast biopsies site B, 12 H.'. The accompanying requisition matches
 the container's label. The specimen consists of 3 cores of tan and
 fatty tissue, each with a diameter of 0.1 cm, ranging from 1.3 to 1.5
 cm in length. Submitted in toto in one block.

 HER2/neu Oncoprotein Overexpression Immunohistochemistry:
 
 
 The tumor cells show strong complete membranous staining for the
 HER2/neu oncoprotein in 100% of the tumor cells. This indicates that
 there is over-expression of the Her2/neu oncoprotein. This
 corresponds to 3+ positivity. Parallel controls were run with the test
 and were adequate.

 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
 
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION
 DCIS - microinvasion
 
 SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
 A: Sentinel node # 1, right axilla (Not blue)
 B: Sentinel node # 2, right axilla (Not blue)
 C: Right breast
 D: Inferior flap revision medial
 
 
 
 DIAGNOSIS
 A. Sentinel node #1:
 1/1 LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/1).
 
 B. Sentinel node #2 right axilla:
 1/1 LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/1).
 
 C. Right breast mastectomy:
 RESIDUAL IN SITU DUCTAL CARCINOMA.
 
 D. Inferior flap revision medial:
 NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
 
 COMMENT: Sections of the sentinel lymph nodes show 2/2 lymph nodes
 are negative for metastatic carcinoma. This was confirmed using
 immunohistochemical staining with antibody to keratin.
 
 Sections of the right breast mastectomy show the presence of residual
 in situ ductal carcinoma involving 3/15 slides. The largest focus on
 one slide spans a distance of 0.7 cm. No evidence of invasion is
 present. The nests of tumor cells show positivity for myosin smooth
 muscle in myoepithelial cells, which is supportive of the absence of
 invasion. Margins: All margins are negative for in situ carcinoma.
 The closest margin is the posterior margin which is less than 1 mm
 from the DCIS. The revised inferior flap margin is negative for
 malignancy.

 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and '1,
 sentinel node, right axilla, hot and blue'. The accompanying
 requisition matches the container' s label.
 
 The specimen consists of a tan lymph node and adipose tissue measuring
 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The lymph node is serially sectioned and
 submitted in total in 1 block for frozen section. The remaining
 fibrofatty tissue submitted in block 2.
 
 B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and '2,
 sentinel node, right axilla, hot and blue'. The accompanying
 requisition matches the container' s label.
 
 The specimen consists of adipose and tan tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x
 0.5 cm and containing a tan lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.
 The lymph node is bisected submitted in block 1 for frozen section,
 the remaining fibrofatty tissue submitted in block 2.
 
 C. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
 breast sutures short -- superior, long -- lateral'. The accompanying
 requisition matches the container' s label.
 
 Specimen consists of an oriented right simple mastectomy specimen with
 a long suture on the lateral margin and a short suture on the superior
 margin, as per the requisition. The specimen measures 19.5-cm ML by
 15.0-cm SI by 3.0-cm AP. The specimen contains a horizontally
 oriented ellipse of skin that measures 11.2-cm ML by 5.9-cm SI.
 Nipple and areola are present and appear unremarkable. The skin
 contains a curvilinear well-healed scar in the upper outer quadrant
 with a length of 4.0-cm. The surgical margin on the specimen is
 painted with blue dye. The specimen is composed of fibrofatty tissue,
 predominantly adipose tissue. Located in the upper outer quadrant of
 the specimen is an area of fibrosis corresponding to a possible
 previous lumpectomy site corresponding to the superficial skin scar.
 In total the fibrosis measures 3.8-cm ML by up to 3.2-cm SI by up to
 2.0-cm AP. The approximate surgical margins to this area of fibrosis
 are as follows: Lateral -- 5 .0 cm, medial -- 6 .5 cm, superior -- 4
 .3 cm, inferior -- 4 .2 cm, anterior -- at anterior margin, posterior
 -- 0.1-cm. no mass is identified in the specimen. The specimen is
 serially sectioned and submitted to mammography for x-ray.
 Representative sections are submitted as per the accompanying diagram
 and as follows:
 
 1 lateral margin, slice 1
 2 4 metal clip, inferior of slice 6, lateral to medial
 5, 6 lateral edge, fibrosis, slice 6
 7 9 area of fibrosis, slice 7, including anterior and posterior
 margins
 10 superior margin, slice 8
 11 inferior margin, slice 8
 12, 13 fibrosis, slice 9
 14 medial edge of fibrosis, slice 10
 15 nipple and areola, slice 10
 16 medial margin, slice 14
 
 D. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and
 'inferior flap revision, medial'. The accompanying requisition matches
 the container' s label.
 
 The specimen consists of an irregularly shaped, an oriented piece of
 unremarkable fibrofatty tissue. The specimen measures 8.0 x 4.0 x 2.3
 cm. Representative cross-sections to the specimen are submitted in
 blocks 1 through 3.

     Comment: Representative sections of the localization lumpectomy show
     the presence of high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma of no special
     type. The tumour extends 0.6 cm (6 millimeters) superiorly, beyond the
     gross lesion, therefore it measures 2.7 cm in its largest dimension.
     Extensive lymphovascular invasion is noted in peritumoral tissue and
     away from the tumour on multiple blocks.
     Hormone receptor and Her-2/neu status will be reported in an addendum.

     Comment: Representative sections of the localization lumpectomy show
     the presence of high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma of no special
     type. The tumour extends 0.6 cm (6 millimeters) superiorly, beyond the
     gross lesion, therefore it measures 2.7 cm in its largest dimension.
     Extensive lymphovascular invasion is noted in peritumoral tissue and
     away from the tumour on multiple blocks.
     Hormone receptor and Her-2/neu status will be reported in an addendum.

 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
 breast'. The accompanying requisition matches the container's label.
 The specimen consists of a simple mastectomy oriented, per the
 requisition, suture axillary tail. The specimen measures 22.0 cm SI
 by 24.0 cm ML by 6.3 cm AP. The resection margin is painted with blue
 dye. Skin is present measuring 8.0 cm SI by 18.0 cm ML. Nipple and
 areola appear grossly unremarkable. Two scars are present the first
 is oblique present within the upper outer quadrant measuring 5.0 cm in
 length. The second scar is irregular in shape and located superior
 to the oblique scar and present within the upper outer quadrant at the
 12:30 position measuring 1.5 cm SI by 1.8 cm ML. Deep to both scars
 there is a previous surgical site present straddling the upper and
 lower outer quadrants and measuring 7.0 cm SI by 7.0 cm ML by 4.2 cm
 AP (present within slices 2-5). Gross resection margins to this area
 are anterior tethering the skin, posterior tethering, superior 1.0 cm
 (superoanterior located at 1.5 cm superior to the superior skin
 margin, inferior 3.0 cm, medial 7.5 cm and lateral 4.0 cm. Upon
 palpating this scarred region it has a firm nodular quality. Located
 within the lower outer quadrant there is a second poorly defined firm
 area of nodularity 1.0 cm medial and 1.5 cm inferior to the surgical
 site and covering a region measuring 1.5 cm SI by 1.5 cm ML by 1.5 cm
 AP (slices 6-7). Gross resection margins to this area are anterior
 2.0 cm, posterior 2.7 cm, superior 11.5 cm, inferior 1.8 cm, medial
 4.0 cm and lateral 10.5 cm. Also present within the lower outer
 quadrant inferiorly adjacent to the scarred region there is a brown
 well defined nodule close to the lateral edge of the surgical site
 (slice 3) measuring 0.7 cm SI by 0.5 cm ML by 0.5 cm AP. Gross
 resection margins to this nodule are anterior 3.8 cm, posterior 1.0
 cm, superior 12.5 cm, inferior 8.8 cm, medial 4.0 cm and lateral 14.0
 cm. No other discrete masses are grossly identified. The specimen is
 serially sectioned from lateral to medial aspect into 10 slices and
 photocopied. Representative sections submitted as per the
 accompanying diagram as follows:
 1 Lateral resection margin to the previous surgical site and a
 brown nodule
 2 Lateral resection margin to the firm area of nodularity present
 within the lower inner quadrant
 3 Most lateral aspect of previous surgical site, slice 2,
 including posterior resection margin (not a full thickness section the
 
 slice)

 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
 breast'. The accompanying requisition matches the container's label.
 The specimen consists of a simple mastectomy oriented, per the
 requisition, suture axillary tail. The specimen measures 22.0 cm SI
 by 24.0 cm ML by 6.3 cm AP. The resection margin is painted with blue
 dye. Skin is present measuring 8.0 cm SI by 18.0 cm ML. Nipple and
 areola appear grossly unremarkable. Two scars are present the first
 is oblique present within the upper outer quadrant measuring 5.0 cm in
 length. The second scar is irregular in shape and located superior
 to the oblique scar and present within the upper outer quadrant at the
 12:30 position measuring 1.5 cm SI by 1.8 cm ML. Deep to both scars
 there is a previous surgical site present straddling the upper and
 lower outer quadrants and measuring 7.0 cm SI by 7.0 cm ML by 4.2 cm
 AP (present within slices 2-5). Gross resection margins to this area
 are anterior tethering the skin, posterior tethering, superior 1.0 cm
 (superoanterior located at 1.5 cm superior to the superior skin
 margin, inferior 3.0 cm, medial 7.5 cm and lateral 4.0 cm. Upon
 palpating this scarred region it has a firm nodular quality. Located
 within the lower outer quadrant there is a second poorly defined firm
 area of nodularity 1.0 cm medial and 1.5 cm inferior to the surgical
 site and covering a region measuring 1.5 cm SI by 1.5 cm ML by 1.5 cm
 AP (slices 6-7). Gross resection margins to this area are anterior
 2.0 cm, posterior 2.7 cm, superior 11.5 cm, inferior 1.8 cm, medial
 4.0 cm and lateral 10.5 cm. Also present within the lower outer
 quadrant inferiorly adjacent to the scarred region there is a brown
 well defined nodule close to the lateral edge of the surgical site
 (slice 3) measuring 0.7 cm SI by 0.5 cm ML by 0.5 cm AP. Gross
 resection margins to this nodule are anterior 3.8 cm, posterior 1.0
 cm, superior 12.5 cm, inferior 8.8 cm, medial 4.0 cm and lateral 14.0
 cm. No other discrete masses are grossly identified. The specimen is
 serially sectioned from lateral to medial aspect into 10 slices and
 photocopied. Representative sections submitted as per the
 accompanying diagram as follows:

     COMMENT: The core biopsies from the inferior and superior right breast
     show a well differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise
     specified and a ductal carcinoma in situ, solid type. The invasive
     component has a low nuclear grade and grows predominantly in lobular
     pattern of infiltration with no tubule formation. The nuclear grade of
     the in situ carcinoma is low. Comedo necrosis is not identified. There
     is no evidence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion in the
     sections examined.
     E- cadherin immunohistochemistry demonstrates complete membranous
     stain which supports ductal origin.

     DIAGNOSIS
     Part A - Right breast lower cluster, core biopsy:
     - COLUMNAR CELL CHANGES
     - ONE DUCT WITH ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA, please see comment
     - STROMAL FIBROSIS AND LOBULAR ATROPHY

     Part B - Right breast upper cluster, core biopsy:
     - STROMAL FIBROSIS AND LOBULAR ATROPHY
     - MICROCALCIFICATIONS PRESENT
     
     Comment: sections of both sites show changes possibly secondary to
     radiation characterized by stromal fibrosis, lobular atrophy,
     intralobular fibrosis and thickening of basement membrane. On site A
     there are also columnar cell changes with hyperplasia, and one duct
     forms a more complex architecture; however there is no cytologic
     atypia. The lesion is minimal and observed only on one level.
     Conservative approach can be considered in this case if the entire
     radiological abnormality has been totally removed and is clinically
     desired.

     COMMENT:
     A.  The core biopsy shows the presence of moderately differentiated
     invasive ductal carcinoma NOS.  Foci of in situ ductal carcinoma of
     the solid subtype are present.  The nuclear grade of in situ ductal
     carcinoma is 1-2/3.  The invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma show
     membranous positivity for E-cadherin which is supportive of ductal
     origin.  Foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion are present.
     
     B.  The core biopsy shows the presence of moderately differentiated
     invasive ductal carcinoma NOS.  In situ ductal carcinoma of the solid
     subtype is present.  The nuclear grade of in situ ductal carcinoma is
     1-2/3.
     
     C.  The core biopsy shows the presence of proliferative fibrocystic
     changes.  Focal usual ductal hyperplasia is present.  These foci show
     positivity for CK5/6 which is supportive of benign ductal
     proliferation.  Focal columnar cell changes are also present.

     COMMENT
     The core biopsy of the left breast show a large core of invasive duct
     carcinoma and 3 small fragments of invasive duct carcinoma. Most of
     the tumor is negative for Her 2 Neu oncoprotein and Her2 Neu gene
     amplification. However there is one fragment of about 2mm showing
     positive Her 2 Neu overexpressionscore3+ and Her2 Neu gene
     amplification score 6. This heterogenous pattern of expression can
     occur but is relatively rare. Since this is only a core biopsy the
     extent of the positive and negative Her2 Neu status in the whole tumor
     need to be assessed on the surgical excision specimen.

     COMMENT:  The core biopsy shows the presence of one duct with a
     cribriform morphology. The features in this duct are those of low
     grade in situ ductal carcinoma, cribriform type.  Adjacent ducts show
     focal atypical ductal hyperplasia. Since only one duct shows features
     of low grade in situ ductal carcinoma, the diagnosis is consistent
     with atypical ductal hyperplasia. Dystrophic calcification is noted
     within the breast ducts.

     COMMENT:
     The medial aspect of the specimens shows extensive fibrocystic
     changes, including several radial scars, one of which shows a focus of
     atypical ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell changes, extensive
     sclerosing adenosis, usual duct hyperplasia and benign intraduct
     papilloma.
     In the middle of the specimen extending to within 1 cm of the lateral
     margin is an area of in-situ duct carcinoma, micropapillary type
     admixed with columnar cell hyperplasia with atypia.  The in-situ duct
     carcinoma has similar morphology to the columnar cell hyperplasia with
     atypia, but in the in-situ areas there is more architectural and
     nuclear atypia than in the columnar cell changes.  This focus measures
     2.5 cm (25 mm) in the medial-lateral direction (5 adjacent tissue
     slices of 0.5 cm thickness each).  On the slide the largest diameter
     of the lesion is 1 x 0.6 cm (10 x 6 mm).
     The invasive lobular carcinoma is lateral to the in-situ duct
     carcinoma by approx. 0.5 cm.

     COMMENT:
     The medial aspect of the specimens shows extensive fibrocystic
     changes, including several radial scars, one of which shows a focus of
     atypical ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell changes, extensive
     sclerosing adenosis, usual duct hyperplasia and benign intraduct
     papilloma.
     In the middle of the specimen extending to within 1 cm of the lateral
     margin is an area of in-situ duct carcinoma, micropapillary type
     admixed with columnar cell hyperplasia with atypia.  The in-situ duct
     carcinoma has similar morphology to the columnar cell hyperplasia with
     atypia, but in the in-situ areas there is more architectural and
     nuclear atypia than in the columnar cell changes.  This focus measures
     2.5 cm (25 mm) in the medial-lateral direction (5 adjacent tissue
     slices of 0.5 cm thickness each).  On the slide the largest diameter
     of the lesion is 1 x 0.6 cm (10 x 6 mm).
     The invasive lobular carcinoma is lateral to the in-situ duct
     carcinoma by approx. 0.5 cm.

     The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast lumpectomy '. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.  The specimen consists of a lumpectomy oriented,
     per the requisition, long stitch lateral, short stitch superior.  The
     specimen measures 5.5 cm SI x 8.0 cm ML x 3.5 cm AP.  The superior
     portion of the specimen is painted green, the inferior blue and the
     anterior and posterior midportion of painted red.  Two localization
     wires are present the first with the hook in the central anterior
     specimen aspect exiting the inferior aspect of the specimen the second
     is in the lateral posterior specimen aspect.  The specimen is serially
     sectioned from medial to lateral aspect into 12 slices.  The first
     described localization wire was present exiting the anterior/inferior
     portion of slice 6, the second localization wire was present within

AND CORE BIOPSY

HISTORY: Left mammographic and sonographic mass and
calcifications, outside FNA positive but core biopsy negative for
malignancy. Right sonographic mass.

Films were compared with previous outside imaging.

FINDINGS:

MAMMOGRAM/MAGNIFICATION VIEWS:

The breast tissue is dense.

There is an obscured mass in the left lower outer anterior breast
with overlying calcifications; the calcifications that directly
overlie the mass are fine and irregular. Some additional
calcifications extend roughly 4 cm posterior and 5 cm superior to
the mass are punctate and loosely scattered, with a benign
appearance.

There are right central calcifications; magnification views show
these to be in a loose cluster with some punctate calcifications
and many of the calcifications showing layering on the straight
lateral view, with a benign appearance

There is no architectural distortion.

BIOPSY:

Informed consent. Sterile technique and ultrasound guidance used.
The skin/subcutaneous tissues over the axillary lymph node and
breast mass were infiltrated with 5 cc of 2% lidocaine. An 18G
needle was inserted into the axillary lymph node cortex and
aspiration was performed. Sample sent in a container to cytology.
No immediate complications. A skin nick was made over the breast
mass. A 14G core biopsy needle was used to obtain 4 samples
however the samples were small and fragmented, thus a 16G core
biopsy needle was used to obtain 5 samples. Samples sent in
container to pathology. No immediate complications.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right and left mammographic calcifications are likely benign,
recommend 6 month follow up magnification views.

2. Right sonographic mass is likely benign, recommend 6 month
targeted ultrasound.

3. Left mammographic and sonographic mass and overlying
calcifications are suspicious - core biopsy was performed and an
addendum will be dictated when pathology results are available.

4. Left axillary lymph node is indeterminate - fine needle
aspiration was performed and an addendum will be dictated when
cytology results are available.

5. Dense breasts. Due to the suspicious mass, recommend breast
MRI. Please submit a requisition for this.

Addendum # 1 by Carrie Betel on 2009-Oct-14 0937

ADDENDUM:

Cytology of the axillary lymph node is benign. This is concordant
with imaging. Recommend 6 month ultrasound follow up.

Pathology shows ALH/LCIS. Please refer to the full pathology
report. This could be concordant with imaging however surgical
excision is recommended to exclude underlying invasive malignancy.

Note that breast MRI has been performed, please refer to that
report for MRI findings and recommendations.

Also note that bilateral magnification views and right targeted
ultrasound in 6 months are also recommended.

     Right breast biopsy - 14G x5  cores
     
     
     
     DIAGNOSIS
     Right breast, core biopsy:
     WELL-DIFFERENTIATED INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST
     
     COMMENT:
     Sections show a well differentiated invasive duct carcinoma where most
     if not all of the tumour grows in tubules and nuclear grade is low.
     This may represent a tubular carcinoma, but this is best established
     on an excision specimen.  Invasive tumour necrosis and lymphovascular
     invasion are not seen.  Receptor studies will be reported in an
     addendum.
     
     
     
     
     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast biopsy'. The accompanying requisition matches the container' s
     label.The specimen consists of 4 cores of tan and fatty tissue, each
     with a diameter of 0.2 cm, ranging from 0.7 to 1.3 cm in length.
     Submitted in toto in one block.

     HER2/neu Oncoprotein Overexpression Immunohistochemistry:
     Representative sections of this tumor were stained with the monoclonal
     antibody 4B5 (rabbit) monoclonal (Ventana) raised against the HER2/neu
     oncoprotein. The tumor cells show equivocal membranous staining (2+),
     therefore further testing using in-situ hybridization will be done and
     an addendum report will follow. Parallel controls were run with the
     test case and were adequate.

     COMMENT:
     Sections show a single duct involved by in-situ carcinoma showing high
     nuclear grade and comedo necrosis.  A small group of malignant cells
     present is seen separately from the tissue core, detached from the
     stroma.  These probably represent detached fragments of in-situ
     carcinoma.  Although only a single involved duct is seen, the high
     nuclear grade and comedo necrosis classifies this as in-situ
     carcinoma.

     Comment:
     The core biopsy shows the presence of in situ ductal carcinoma of the
     micropapillary and clinging subtypes. The nuclear grade is 3/3. Some
     dissociated groups of poorly differentiated tumor cells are present.
     They could be from either the DCIS or from invasive carcinoma.
     Calcification is noted in the breast tissue. A small fibroadenoma is
     also present. .

     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     simple mastectomy'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container's label.  The specimen consists of a simple skin sparing
     mastectomy oriented, per the requisition, ""long lateral, short
     superior"" with the resection margin painted blue.  The specimen has a
     time of excision of 0905 hours and at time of formalin fixation of
     0928 hours.  The specimen measures 17.5 cm SI by 17 cm ML by 3 cm AP,
     with an attached ellipse of skin measuring 2.8 cm SI by 6.0 cm ML
     which includes nipple and areola.  The nipple is a diameter of 1.1 cm
     and is everted.  The skin has an area of blue discoloration consistent
     with dye injected at the time of surgery for the assessment of
     sentinel lymph nodes centered on the nipple measuring 3.5 cm in
     greatest dimension, and which upon cut sectioning measures 9 cm SI by
     7 cm ML by 2.5 cm AP.  The specimen is serially sectioned from medial
     to lateral and is found to be comprised of 50% dense fibroglandular
     tissue.  No masses are noted (prophylactic mastectomy, BRCA1 carrier;

MRI GUIDED VACUUM ASSISTED BREAST BIOPSY

CLINICAL HISTORY: BRCA1, Lumpectomy x 2 in 2009 for DCIS, left upper inner lumpectomy for ADH with microcalcifications

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on a 1.5 T GE magnet.  Localizer images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:3.6, TR:18, 2 mm slices) images, pre and  post iv gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg, bolus
injection), axial 2D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:170, 2.5 mm slices) enhanced images, pre- and post coaxial needle introducer insertion and post biopsy, clip insertion were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAMS:MRI from 01/11/2012

PROCEDURE:

Informed consent was obtained. Aseptic technique was used.  After MR imaging, The area of non mass like enhancement in the upper outer right breast was visualized \T\  targeted for biopsy.  The lesion coordinates were calculated using computer
software assistance. After local anesthetic, 1 percent Xylocaine both with and without epinephrine was administered, the trocar coaxial needle system was placed using a lateral approach.  Once accurate placement was confirmed in sagittal and axial
planes, the region was sampled using a 9 gauge vacuum assisted device.  There were no immediate complications.  A clip was placed after the biopsy with MR images confirming placement at the biopsy site.  Specimens were sent to pathology.

Post procedure mammograms were obtained confirming location of the clip.

IMPRESSION:

Uneventful MRI guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of the right upper outer breast lesion.  An addendum will be issued to this report when the pathology results are available.



PATHOLOGY RESULTS:  DCIS

THIS IS CONCORDANT WITH IMAGING.  SURGICAL REFERRAL SUGGESTED.

     D. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast'. The accompanying requisition matches the container's label.
     The specimen consists of an oriented right breast (short silk marks
     superior, and a long stitch lateral margin) measuring 21cm ML x 20cm
     SI x 6cm AP.  The breast margins painted green.  The attached skin is
     oval and measures 6.5cm ML x 6cm SI.  The areola measures 3 cm in
     diameter, the nipple measures 1 cm in diameter and is raised 0.6 cm.
     The areola surrounding the nipple is slightly retracted.  The specimen
     is serially sectioned from the medial to the lateral aspect and

CLINICAL HISTORY: suspicious for recurrence medial right breast 3 o'clock 2 cm from nipple

PROCEDURE:

Targeted ultrasound was obtained and the previously described abnormality was identified.

Following informed consent and using sterile technique and local anaesthesia (1% xylocaine), core biopsies were obtained with ultrasound guidance using a ML approach. A skin incision was made and cores were obtained with a 14 gauge tru-cut needle in
an automated gun. Through the same incision several passes were made in order to sample different areas. 4 cores were obtained.

There were no immediate complications. The patient was given a sheet of post biopsy instructions.

The patient was requested to contact her referring physician for the results.

CORE PATHOLOGY: highly suspicious for ductal carcinoma in situ. This result is concordant.

MRI is recommended for further assessment.

--- Addendum ---
ADDENDUM:

This case was discussed at breast multidisciplinary rounds May 31, 2012.  Repeat stereotactic guided biopsy with vacuum assistance has been recommended to try to obtain a larger sample of tissue and confirm a diagnosis of DCIS definitively prior to
planning surgical treatment.

CLINICAL INDICATION:
1. Indeterminant non-mass enhancement in left lower outer breast (previous image 19) for biopsy
2. Prior right breast MRI guided biopsy (pathology: DCIS) shows postbiopsy clip more lateral than expected.

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on a 1.5 T GE magnet.  Localizer images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:3.6, TR:18, 2 mm slices) images, pre and  post iv gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg, bolus
injection), axial 2D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:170, 2.5 mm slices) enhanced images, pre- and post coaxial needle introducer insertion and post biopsy, clip insertion were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAMS: MRI 04/27/2013.

RIGHT BREAST MRI:
Limited MRI images obtained.  There is a hematoma at site of previous biopsy in the right breast.  The postbiopsy clip is displaced and positioned on the lateral aspect of this hematoma.  The previously biopsied enhancement is no longer seen
(possibly obscured by hematoma or removed).

LEFT BREAST MRI BIOPSY:
Informed consent was obtained. Aseptic technique was used.  After MR imaging, the left breast enhancement was visualized \T\  targeted for biopsy.  The lesion coordinates were calculated using computer software assistance. After local anesthetic, 1
percent Xylocaine both with and without epinephrine was administered, the trocar coaxial needle system was placed using a lateral approach.  Once accurate placement was confirmed in sagittal and axial planes, the region was sampled using a 9 gauge
vacuum assisted device.  There were no immediate complications.  A clip was placed after the biopsy with MR images confirming placement at the biopsy site.  Specimens were sent to pathology.

Post procedure mammograms demonstrate the clip is positioned more medially than expected.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited MRI images of the right breast were obtained.  These demonstrate a hematoma at site of previous biopsy with the postbiopsy clip being displaced to the lateral aspect of this hematoma.  We will bring the patient back for a targeted
ultrasound in 10 days, at which time we will reassess the hematoma and position of clip.  At that time, it will be determined if we will deploy a second clip to mark site of prior biopsy using the medial aspect of the hematoma for a landmark.  This
appointment will be facilitated.

2. Uneventful MRI guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of the left breast lesion.  The postbiopsy clip is positioned more medially than expected.  We will await the pathology results, which should be available when the patient comes back in 10 days for the
right breast ultrasound.  If necessary (i.e. if pathology is not benign), the left breast biopsy site and clip position can be reassessed at the same time.

History: Biopsy proven invasive carcinoma 9-10 o'clock right breast.  Ultrasound described 2 other suspicious lesions one at 12 o'clock and the other at 1 o'clock.  MRI showed only one lesion in addition to the cancer.

Initially the right breast was rescanned.  At 1 o'clock 5 cm from the nipple there is a 7 mm ill-defined hypoechoic shadowing mass that would correspond with the MRI finding.  On reviewing the static images from the ultrasound from 07/27/2011 there
is probably only one lesion but this was located at a slightly different position when the patient was re-scanned.

     DIAGNOSIS
     Left breast mastectomy: MALIGNANT PHYLLODES TUMOR (SEE COMMENT)
     NO INVOLVEMENT OF MARGINS
     
     Comment:
     Sections of the breast show the presence of a fibroepithelial tumor
     with a maximum dimension of 10cm. The tumor shows stromal overgrowth
     with focal areas of increased cellularity. The stromal cells show
     moderate pleomorphism. Some areas of the tumor show >10 mitoses per 10
     high power fields. Focal fresh hemorrhage is noted within the tumor.
     No necrosis is present. Some ducts within the tumor show florid ductal
     hyperplasia with atypia. The features are consistent with the
     diagnosis of a malignant phyllodes tumor. All margins are negative for
     malignancy. The tumor extends into the fascia but does not involve the
     underlying muscle. The closest margin is the posterior margin which is
     2mm from the tumor. The surrounding breast tissue shows the presence
     of proliferative fibrocystic changes with ductal hyperplasia without
     atypia and columnar cell changes. Focal aggregates of lymphocytes are
     notes within the breast tissue. Biopsy site reaction is present. The
     skin shows no pathological abnormalities
     
     
     
     
     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast'. The accompanying requisition matches the container's label.
     
     The specimen consists of an oriented left simple mastectomy specimen
     (silk marks the lateral aspect) measuring 21 cm M. L. by 23 cm S. I.
     and up to 8.5 cm AP.  The breast margins painted blue.  The attached
     skin ellipse measures 17 cm M. L. and 9 cm S. I.  No skin scars
     present.  The nipple is retracted and measures 1.5-cm in diameter.
     The breast is serially sectioned from the lateral to the medial aspect
     and displays a well demarcated soft tan and partly hemorrhagic
     lobulated mass with partly translucent and mucinous /myxoid
     degenerated appearance measuring 10 cm M. L. by 8 cm S. I. and 8 cm
     AP, involving the inner upper and inner lower quadrants.  It is
     abutting the posterior breast margin, located at 1 cm from the skin, 3
     cm from the superior margin, 2.5 cm from the inferior margin, 4 cm
     from the medial margin and 8 cm from the lateral margin.  It displays
     few yellow areas and central scarlike retraction.  The rest of the
     breast consists of adipose tissue with fibrosis more prominent over
     the central inferior aspect measuring 8 cm in greatest dimension.

     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     simple mastectomy'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container's label.  The specimen consists of a simple skin sparing
     mastectomy oriented, per the requisition, ""long lateral, short
     superior"" with the resection margin painted blue.  The specimen has a
     time of excision of 0905 hours and at time of formalin fixation of
     0928 hours.  The specimen measures 17.5 cm SI by 17 cm ML by 3 cm AP,
     with an attached ellipse of skin measuring 2.8 cm SI by 6.0 cm ML
     which includes nipple and areola.  The nipple is a diameter of 1.1 cm
     and is everted.  The skin has an area of blue discoloration consistent
     with dye injected at the time of surgery for the assessment of
     sentinel lymph nodes centered on the nipple measuring 3.5 cm in
     greatest dimension, and which upon cut sectioning measures 9 cm SI by
     7 cm ML by 2.5 cm AP.  The specimen is serially sectioned from medial
     to lateral and is found to be comprised of 50% dense fibroglandular

     Comment:
     A: Sections of the left breast shows the presence of 2 fibroadenomas.
     The one shows fibrocystic changes with apocrine metaplasia and is
     consistent with a complex fibroadenoma. The breast tissue also shows
     duct ectasia, non proliferative fibrocystic changes, columnar cell
     changes and hyperplasia. No evidence of atypia or malignancy is noted.

CLINICAL HISTORY: New indeterminate 4 mm focus of enhancement in the right retroareolar breast. BIRADS 4.

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on a 1.5 T GE magnet.  Localizer images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:3.6, TR:18, 2 mm slices) images, pre and  post iv gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg, bolus
injection), axial 2D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:170, 2.5 mm slices) enhanced images, pre- and post coaxial needle introducer insertion and post biopsy, clip insertion were obtained.  Note that reformat images are obtained during procedure
planning on accessory computer, but are not saved to PACS.

Comparison made to prior imaging.

PROCEDURE: MRI confirms persistence of the MRI lesion.

Informed consent obtained, sterile technique and MR guidance used.  The area was localized by MR imaging.  The skin was injected with 3 cc of 2% lidocaine and the subcutaneous tissues were injected with 10 cc of lidocaine and epinephrine.  A skin
nick was made.  MRI confirmed needle position and with a 9G vacuum core biopsy needle, petite (lateral approach), 12 samples were obtained. Samples sent to pathology.

Post biopsy mammograms shows the clip slightly more medial in position than the expected focus of enhancement, along the medial portion of the small post biopsy hematoma.

The patient called the department from home as she was experiencing bleeding from the biopsy site. She was advised to apply firm pressure to the area along with ice, and that if she cannot stop the bleeding at home, to present to the emergency
department for treatment.

MRI GUIDED VACUUM ASSISTED BREAST BIOPSY

CLINICAL HISTORY: BRCA 2. Indeterminate non-mass enhancement 6 to
8 o'clock position right breast with no sonographic correlate.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on
a 1.5 T GE magnet. Localizer images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D
FSPGR fat saturated (TE:3.6, TR:18, 2 mm slices) images, pre and
post iv gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg, bolus injection), axial
2D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:170, 2.5 mm slices) enhanced
images, pre- and post coaxial needle introducer insertion and post
biopsy, clip insertion were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAMS:

PROCEDURE:

Informed consent was obtained. Aseptic technique was used. After
MR imaging, the sparse regional enhancement in the inferior lower
outer right breast was visualized, the most clumped aspect
targeted for biopsy. The lesion coordinates were calculated using
computer software assistance. After local anesthetic, 1 percent
Xylocaine both with and without epinephrine was administered, the
trocar coaxial needle system was placed using a lateral approach.
Once accurate placement was confirmed in sagittal and axial
planes, the region was sampled using a 9 gauge vacuum assisted
device. 12 samples were obtained. A 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.9 cm hematoma
was present at the biopsy site on immediate post biopsy images. A
clip was placed after the biopsy with MR images confirming both
accurate sampling and placement of the clip at the biopsy site.
Uneventful.

Specimens were sent to pathology.

Post procedure mammograms were obtained confirming location of the
clip.

OPINION:

Uneventful MRI guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of low suspicion
non-mass breast lesion. An addendum will be issued to this report
when the pathology results are available.

PATHOLOGY: Benign breast tissue with ruptured ducts. Imaging is
concordant with pathology. 6 month follow-up MRI recommended.

ULTRASOUND-GUIDED LEFT BREAST BIOPSY and clip placement
LEFT MAMMOGRAM

HISTORY:  For second look ultrasound of a left retroareolar mass seen on screening MRI.  BRCA 1 and family history of breast cancer.

Comparison was made with prior imaging.

FINDINGS:  Targeted ultrasound was performed of the left retroareolar breast.  In the direct retroareolar region there is an oval well defined hypoechoic nodule with slight internal vascularity measuring 4 x 3 x 2 mm.  This could correlate to the
MRI lesion and was later chosen for biopsy.  A second similar lesion was seen in the 4 o'clock position 1 cm from the nipple measuring 4 x 4 x 2 mm, this is not significantly changed from the previous ultrasound of May 2011 and does not appear to
correlate with the MRI finding.

Informed consent was obtained.  Using ultrasound guidance, 8 cc of 2% lidocaine were injected into the skin and subcutaneous tissues over the lesion.  Using a 14G core biopsy needle, 4 core samples were obtained.  Samples were sent to pathology.  No
immediate complications.  Post biopsy, the small lesion was very difficult to visualize.

A post biopsy clip was placed under ultrasound guidance.  The clip appears to lie slightly lateral to the lesion.  The clip is seen on subsequent mammogram.

IMPRESSION:  Successful left ultrasound-guided core biopsy of a probably benign nodule.  An addendum report will be dictated when the pathology results are available.

--- Addendum ---
ADDENDUM:

Pathology shows a portion of a papillary lesion, with atypia.  Please see the full pathology report.  This is concordant with imaging and surgical consultation with view to excision is recommended.  A second similar tiny lesion is noted on
ultrasound very nearby and consideration of removal in the same lumpectomy sample should be considered.

Follow up ultrasound and MRI in 6 months is also suggested.

HISTORY:  New mass near previous left benign surgery, upper outer quadrant - for biopsy.  History of mother with bilateral DCIS age 38.

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on a 1.5 T GE magnet.  Localizer images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:3.6, TR:18, 2 mm slices) images, pre and  post iv gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg, bolus
injection), axial 2D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:170, 2.5 mm slices) enhanced images, pre- and post coaxial needle introducer insertion and post biopsy, clip insertion were obtained.

Compared to prior imaging

PROCEDURE:  The left upper outer posterior small enhancing mass is again seen but is much less pronounced than previous.

Informed consent was obtained. Aseptic technique was used.  After MR imaging, the enhancing mass in the left upper outer quadrant at the edge of the scar was visualized and targeted for biopsy.  The lesion coordinates were calculated using computer
software assistance. After local anesthetic, 1 percent Xylocaine both with and without epinephrine was administered, the Petit trocar coaxial needle system was placed using a lateral approach and Petit needle.  Once accurate placement was confirmed
in sagittal and axial planes, the region was sampled using a 9 gauge vacuum assisted device. 12 samples were obtained. There were no immediate complications.  A clip was placed after the biopsy with MR images confirming placement at the biopsy site.
 Specimens were sent to pathology.

Post procedure mammograms were obtained confirming location of the clip.

IMPRESSION:  Uneventful MRI guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of the left upper outer quadrant breast lesion, probably benign.  An addendum will be issued to this report when the pathology results are available.

CLINICAL HISTORY: nipple discharge with intraductal lesion seen on ductography and ultrasound at 4 o'clock 1 cm from nipple. History of surgical resection for papillomas.

PROCEDURE:

Following informed consent and using sterile technique and local anaesthesia (1% xylocaine with and without adrenalin), core biopsies were obtained with ultrasound guidance. A small skin incision was made and cores were obtained with a 12 gauge
probe using vacuum assistance and a ML approach. The probe was rotated in order to obtain several samples from different areas. 6 cores were obtained.

The procedure was technically difficult as the freezing obscured the small lesion.

A clip was positioned at the biopsy site to aid in localization if further biopsy is needed. Post procedure CC and lateral mammograms show the clip in satisfactory position.

There were no immediate complications. The patient was given a sheet of post biopsy instructions.

The patient was requested to contact her referring physician to obtain the results.

CORE PATHOLOGY: fragment of large duct papilloma without atypia, please see report.

Despite the vacuum assistance the lesion has not been completely excised. The procedure was technically difficult due to the small size of the lesion which was obscured by the freezing.  If surgical excision is not obtained then follow up right
ultrasound in six months recommended.

CLINICAL HISTORY: New enhancing mass anterior left breast with linear non-mass enhancement seen posteriorly.

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on a 1.5 T GE magnet.  Localizer images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:3.6, TR:18, 2 mm slices) images, pre and  post iv gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg, bolus
injection), axial 2D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:170, 2.5 mm slices) enhanced images, pre- and post coaxial needle introducer insertion and post biopsy, clip insertion were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAMS:MRI 27/05/2012

PROCEDURE:

Informed consent was obtained. Aseptic technique was used.  After MR imaging, the left breast mass was visualized \T\  targeted for biopsy.  The lesion coordinates were calculated using computer software assistance. After local anesthetic, 1 percent
Xylocaine both with and without epinephrine was administered, the trocar coaxial needle system was placed using a lateral approach.  Once accurate placement was confirmed in sagittal and axial planes, the region was sampled using a 9 gauge vacuum
assisted device.  There were no immediate complications.  A clip was placed after the biopsy with MR images confirming placement at the biopsy site.  Specimens were sent to pathology.

Post procedure mammograms were obtained confirming location of the clip. The final position of the clip placed today is likely more medial than the biopsy target (z axis migration). If surgical excision is required, the clip noted on image 14 on the
MRI from 27/05/2012 should serve as the target for wire localization (more lateral post MRI biopsy clip).

IMPRESSION:

Uneventful MRI guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of the indeterminate left breast lesion.  An addendum will be issued to this report when the pathology results are available.

Pathology

     Left breast biopsy:
     - ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA

     COMMENTS:
     Sections show fibroadenomatoid changes. This is associated with
     columnar cell change with hyperplasia and flat epithelial atypia.
     There are few foci of atypical ductal hyperplasia. Surgical excision
     should be considered.

Pathology is concordant with imaging. Excision is recommended.

Note that the MRI findings were: New enhancing mass anterior left breast. Linear non-mass enhancement extends posteriorly from the mass for approximately 3.5 cm.

The anterior mass was targeted for biopsy.

The final position of the clip placed at the time this biopsy is likely more medial than the biopsy target (z axis migration). The clip noted on image 14 on the MRI from 27/05/2012 should serve as the target for wire localization (more lateral post
MRI biopsy clip).

REFERENCE EXAMS: Bilateral breast MRI August 07, 2015.

PROCEDURE:

Informed consent was obtained. Aseptic technique was used.

After MR imaging, the 2 small mass lesions were identified and targeted for biopsy.

Lesion 1 represents small mass in the upper inner breast anterior 3rd.

Lesion 2 represent small mass in the upper outer breast posterior middle 3rd.

Lesion 1:

The lesion coordinates were calculated using computer software assistance. The skin was injected with 3 cc of 2 % lidocaine and the subcutaneous tissues were injected with 10 cc of lidocaine and epinephrine.  A skin nick was made and the trocar
coaxial needle system was placed using a medial approach.  Once accurate placement was confirmed in sagittal and axial planes, the region was sampled using a 9G vacuum assisted device. 6 cores were obtained.  No immediate complications.  A clip was
placed after the biopsy with MR images confirming placement at the biopsy site.  Specimens were sent to pathology.

Lesion 2:

The lesion coordinates were calculated using computer software assistance. The skin was injected with 3 cc of 2 % lidocaine and the subcutaneous tissues were injected with 10 cc of lidocaine and epinephrine.  A skin nick was made and the trocar
coaxial needle system was placed using a lateral approach.  Once accurate placement was confirmed in sagittal and axial planes, the region was sampled using a 9G vacuum assisted device. 6 cores were obtained.  No immediate complications.  A clip was
placed after the biopsy with MR images demonstrating the clip just medial to the lesion site.  Specimens were sent to pathology.

Post procedure mammograms were obtained. The clip at the site of the mass upper inner anterior 3rd has migrated 1.7cm lateral to the lesion site, and the clip at the site of the mass upper outer posterior middle 3rd again has migrated 3.9cm medial
to the lesion site.

OPINION:

CLINICAL HISTORY: Family history of breast cancer and >25% lifetime risk. Mass in right breast detected on recent screening MRI.  No correlate identified on ultrasound.

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on a 1.5 T GE magnet.  Localizer images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:3.6, TR:18, 2 mm slices) images, pre and  post iv gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg, bolus
injection), axial 2D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:170, 2.5 mm slices) enhanced images, pre- and post coaxial needle introducer insertion and post biopsy, clip insertion were obtained.  Note that reformat images are obtained during procedure
planning on accessory computer, but are not saved to PACS.

COMPARISON: Mammogram and MRI from 11/11/2011.

PROCEDURE:

MRI confirms persistence of the 0.9 cm enhancing mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.

Informed consent obtained, sterile technique and MR guidance used.  The area was localized by MR imaging.  The skin was injected with 3 cc of 2% lidocaine and the subcutaneous tissues were injected with 8 cc of lidocaine and epinephrine.  A skin
nick was made.  MRI confirmed needle position and with a 9G vacuum core biopsy needle (lateral-medial approach), 11 samples were obtained.  During lavage there was a greater than normal amount of bleeding from the site.  Approximately 5cc of
lidocaine and epinephrine was injected after lavage to assist with hemostasis. Firm compression was applied to the site for 5 minutes after the MRI table compression was released.  Hemostasis was achieved. On the post-biopsy MRI images there is a
1.9 x 2.2 x 1.7 cm hematoma at the site.

Samples were sent to pathology.

Post-biopsy MRI sequences show the biopsy clip in place, however due to the hematoma, the position of the mass is altered. The mass is pushed 1.0 - 1.3 cm medially and the clip lies lateral to the mass. The hematoma obscures the mass/clip in the
craniocaudal dimension.

Post biopsy mammograms shows the clip in place.

IMPRESSION:
1. Successful MRI guided biopsy.  An addendum will be dictated when the pathology results are available.
2. Post biopsy hematoma pushed the mass medially and the biopsy clip lies lateral to the mass.

ADDENDUM:

Pathology indicates
     - FIBROADENOMATOID CHANGE
     - COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE
     - BENIGN FIBROGLANDULAR TISSUE

This is concordant with imaging, six month follow up MRI is suggested.

1 percent Xylocaine both with and without epinephrine was administered, the trocar coaxial needle system was placed using a lateral  approach.  Once accurate placement was confirmed in sagittal and axial planes, the region was sampled using a 9
gauge vacuum assisted device.  There were no immediate complications.  A clip was placed after the biopsy with MR images confirming placement at the biopsy site.  Specimens were sent to pathology.

Post procedure mammograms were obtained confirming location of the clip.

IMPRESSION:

Uneventful MRI guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of the nonmass enhancement in the subareolar left breast.  An addendum will be issued to this report when the pathology results are available.

BRCA2. Followup right breast mass.,"MRI GUIDED VACUUM ASSISTED BREAST BIOPSY - right

HISTORY:  For biopsy of a new right upper inner mass seen on recent surveillance MRI.  BRCA 2.

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on a 1.5 T GE magnet.  Localizer images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:3.6, TR:18, 2 mm slices) images, pre and  post iv gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg, bolus
injection), axial 2D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:170, 2.5 mm slices) enhanced images, pre- and post coaxial needle introducer insertion and post biopsy, clip insertion were obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging.

PROCEDURE:  The small mass in the right upper inner quadrant is again seen and targeted for biopsy.  The central posterior mass is also seen (stable from 2009 and likely benign).

Informed consent was obtained. Aseptic technique was used.  After MR imaging,the enhancing mass in the right upper inner breast was visualized and targeted for biopsy.  The lesion coordinates were calculated using computer software assistance. After
local anesthetic, 1 percent Xylocaine both with and without epinephrine was administered, the trocar coaxial needle system was placed using a medial approach. The post needle placement images demonstrated the needle to be slightly off target and
decision was made to retarget the lesion with repeat of the above steps.  Once accurate placement was confirmed in sagittal and axial planes, the region was sampled using a 9 gauge vacuum assisted device (12 samples).  There were no immediate
complications, aside from a small post biopsy hematoma (1.6 x 1.4 x 1.6 cm).  A clip was placed after the biopsy with MR images confirming placement at the biopsy site.  Specimens were sent to pathology.

Post procedure mammograms were obtained confirming location of the clip.

IMPRESSION: Successful MRI guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of a right breast mass, indeterminate.  An addendum will be issued to this report when the pathology results are available.

HISTORY:  For biopsy of a complex cyst in the left medial breast.  Prior benign biopsy of a left breast mass (fibroadenoma).  Family history of breast cancer.

Comparison was made with prior imaging.

FINDINGS:  Ultrasound again shows a cyst in the left breast 9 o'clock position 5 cm from the nipple measuring 8 x 4 x 8 mm.  There are internal avascular thin septations and a slightly nodular but avascular area in the superior lesion.

Informed consent was obtained.  Using ultrasound guidance, 5 cc of 2% lidocaine were injected into the skin and subcutaneous tissues over the lesion.  Using a 14G core biopsy needle and a medial approach, 4 core samples were obtained targeting the
more solid portion.  The lesion was still clearly visible post biopsy.  Samples were sent to pathology.  No immediate complications.

IMPRESSION:  Successful left ultrasound-guided core biopsy of a probably benign lesion.  An addendum report will be dictated when the pathology results are available.

     breast lump'. The accompanying requisition matches the container's
     label.  The specimen consists of an oriented right breast lump (long
     stitch lateral, short stitch superior, double stitch deep) measuring
     5.3 cm mL by 5.5 cm SI by 3.3 cm AP.  The outer surface is painted as
     follows: Superior blue, inferior green, midanterior red, mid posterior
     black.  The breast lump is serially sectioned from lateral to medial
     into 9 slices and photocopied.  Fibrosis extends throughout the
     specimen.  Within slices III through VII is a well-defined firm tan
     mass measuring 1.7 cm AP by 1.4 cm SI by 2.0 cm AP and is located 2.5
     cm from the superior margin, 1.4 cm from the inferior margin, 0.4 cm
     from the anterior margin, 1.0 cm from the posterior margin, 1.6 cm
     from the lateral margin and 2.0 cm from the medial margin.
     Representative sections are submitted as per attached diagram as
     follows:
     1     slice I, lateral resection margin cross sections at level of
     mass

     COMMENT: Sections demonstrate a fibroepithelial lesion. The stromal
     component demonstrates increased stromal cellularity and rare mitotic
     figures. However, no stromal expansion/overgrowth, cytologic atypia or
     necrosis is identified. The ductal epithelial component is
     unremarkable. The overall features are most consistent with
     fibroadenoma with cellular stroma.
