chemo and radiation 1990. Right core biopsy 1999 - stromal
fibrosis and left core biopsy - fibroadenoma 2001.

TECHNIQUE: Axial and coronal T 1 weighted localizer images were
obtained of both breasts. Sagittal T 2 FSE with fat saturation,
sagittal 3D T 1 SPGR images pre and post gadolinium
administration were obtained. Post imaging subtraction images were
produced.

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral breast MRI from 1/25/2002 and 1/26/2001.

FINDINGS:

There is a minimal amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. There is now a mass in the RUIQ centrally measuring 7.0 mm
in maximal dimension. This demonstrates early enhancement and
washout on delayed imaging while the margins are circumscribed and
there are nonenhancing internal septations consist of a new finding

CLINICAL HISTORY: Family history of breast carcinoma. New
palpable abnormality right breast upper outer quadrant.

TECHNIQUE: Axial and coronal T 1 weighted gradient localizer
images were obtained. Sagittal 3D T 1 weighted gradient images
pre and post gadolinium contrast administration and subtracted
images of both breasts were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Breast MR from 2/9/2001.

There is a marked amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts.

At the 9 o'clock axis of the right breast in the posterior 1/3rd
near the chest wall is an irregular mass with spiculated margins
demonstrating heterogeneous rim enhancement. The mass measures
1.1 x 1.4 cm. In addition, in the vicinity just caudad to the
mass is clumped linear enhancement extending from the central
breast through to the 4 and 3 o'clock position surrounding the
mass. This demonstrates suspicious enhancement characteristic
including early arterial enhancement and washout on delayed
imaging. This measures 1.2 x 2.3 cm in maximal dimension and may
represent adjacent DCIS. No evidence of additional foci of
abnormal enhancement in the right breast.

In the left breast, no suspicious foci of enhancement.

IMPRESSION

Suspicious mass right breast, 9 o'clock axis. Adjacent suspicious
linear enhancement from the central breast extending to the 4 and
3 o'clock axis which may represent adjacent DCIS. Core biopsy
under ultrasound guidance of the mass has been arranged. At the
time of ultrasound, further evaluation of the surrounding
abnormality is recommended. If this is sonographically occult,
then preoperative needle-wire localization under MR guidance is
recommended to define the extent of surrounding disease.

Lesion category assessment: 5; Suggestive of malignancy.

Dictated: October 2, 2001



Addendum:

The position of the suspicious rim enhancing mass is at the 9
o'clock axis and not 3 o'clock axis as dictated in the body of
the report.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION:  High risk screening study. BRCA 1 mutation carrier. 6 month follow up probably benign enhancment. Reduction mammoplasties 1997. No HRT or supplements, has gained weight.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated 3D
FSPGR images pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT  were then
obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained. Kinetic curves obtained. Contrast: 9 CC Gadovist

REFERENCE EXAM:  previous breast imaging including mammograms April 2011 and MRI April 2011

LMP: age 48

FINDINGS: moderate amount of scattered fibroglandular tissue with moderate degree of moderate intensity stippled background enhancement. This has shown some further increase compared to April 2011 and definite increase compared to earlier studies.
Post reduction scarring.

In the upper inner right breast, image 75, is a 9 mm area of non mass enhancement. This shows moderate to rapid initial and delayed progressive enhancement and is probably parenchymal.

In the inferior right breast, approximately 6 o'clock, anterior third of breast, images 78-79, there is an irregular area of enhancement. This measures 23 SI x 18 AP x 7 mm TV. There is rapid initial and mixed delayed kinetics with washout and
plateau enhancement. This is becoming more prominent and further investigation is indicated.

SUMMARY

Increasing parenchymal enhancement in addition to scarring from the reduction mammoplasties makes interpretation difficult. The irregular area of inhancement inferior right breast requires further assessment. We will recall the patient for
additional right mammograms and ultrasound with view to possible core biopsy.

If there are no ultrasound findings to biopsy then MR guided biopsy is recommended.  A verbal report with called.  BI-RADS 4.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL HISTORY: High risk screening study. DCIS in the right
breast upper central region. For bilateral mastectomy. Rule out
carcinoma in contralateral breast.

COMPARISON: 13/12/04 and 11/9/03.

TECHNIQUE: Localizer images, sagittal T2 FSE images with fat
saturation, sagittal, T1 3-D SPGR pre and three dynamic post
gadolinium enhanced images were obtained of both breasts. Post
procedure subtracted imaging was performed.

FINDINGS:
The breasts are heterogeneously dense.
In the upper central region of the right breast there is an area
of clumped ductal distributed enhancement. This extends from
image 16 to image 23 and covers a sagittal area of 3.2 x 1.6 cm
(image 19). The most mass like areameasures 1.2 x 0.8 cm (image
18) and likely corresponds to the area recently biopsied and found
to represent DCIS. Additional clumped enhancement extends
laterally into the upper outer quadrant (images 20-23), occupying
2.1 cm of breast parenchyma. This appearance also remains
unchanged and may represent additional extension of DCIS.

In the left breast there is a tiny focus of enhancement in the
upper inner quadrant (image 7). This measures 0.3 cm in maximum
diameter and is unchanged from the previous examination in 2003,
in keeping with benign lesion. No additional enhancement.

IMPRESSION:

Abnormal clumped ductal enhancement in the upper central right
breast consistent with known diagnosis of DCIS, unchanged.
No new or suspicious abnormality demonstrated in the left breast.

delay) enhanced images were obtained of both breasts. Axial,
enhanced T1 weighted 3-D FSPGR, fat-suppressed images through both
breasts were then obtained. Post imaging processing subtraction
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: January 6, 2006.

FINDINGS: The breasts are composed of mostly fibroglandular
tissue. No significant background parenchymal enhancement.

In the axillary tail of the left breast there is a new round mass
with irregular margins and rim enhancement measuring 1.1 cm
maximal dimension (image 5). There is moderate initial and
persistent delayed enhancement and a heterogeneous bright T2
signal. No abnormality through the remainder of either breast.

IMPRESSION: New left breast axillary tail mass, suspicious for
malignancy, either a breast primary in the axillary tail or an
abnormal lymph node. Ultrasound evaluation and core biopsy
recommended.

CLINICAL HISTORY: High risk screening study. Further evaluation
of enhancing left breast lesions.

TECHNIQUE: Localizer images, sagittal T2 weighted fat saturated
images, sagittal T1 weighted 2D SPGR fat saturated pre and post
gadolinium contrast &amp; high resolution sagittal 3-D SPGR fat
saturated images were obtained on the left breast. Kinetic
analysis was performed.

REFERENCE EXAMS: 7/6/2005 and 6/7/2004.

FINDINGS: The left breast is heterogeneously dense. The
previously identified focal enhancement with questioned distortion
in the outer left breast has resolved. There remains a background
stippled parenchymal enhancement pattern.

The irregular mass in the middle 1/3 of the breast, approximately
12 o'clock however persists measuring 1 x 0.9 cm, (series 5, image
14). This demonstrated marked early enhancement and a plateau
delayed enhancement. This lesion was not definitely present on
previous MRI of 2004.

IMPRESSION: Indeterminate left breast mass 12 o'clock. Vacuum
assisted biopsy under MRI guidance is recommended as a sonographic
correlate was not identified.

CLINICAL INDICATION:  OBSP High Risk Screen.

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1

(5.3 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

LMP: N/A

REFERENCE EXAM:  Compared to previous breast imaging studies including most recent MRI dated 19/1/11

FINDINGS:

There is a small amount of fibroglandular tissue with minimal degree/intensity background enhancement.

Stable 5 mm enhancing mass in the right lower outer breast (image 71) is most in keeping with an intramammary node. Previously noted left central breast lesion is not enhancing today and is much less conspicuous.

There is a 5 mm round enhancing lesion in the right upper outer breast (image 75) with rapid early enhancement and washout. It is slightly T2 hyperintense.  It possibly represents an intramammary lymph node and may have been present in 2009
measuring 0.3 cm.  However, it is not seen on the 2008 MR images.

No adenopathy.

IMPRESSION: Possible right upper outer intramammary node (image 75).  Recommend correlation with targeted second look ultrasound. If not seen sonographically, MRI biopsy is recommended.

imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

LMP: N/A

REFERENCE EXAM:  Compared to previous breast imaging studies including most recent MRI dated 19/1/11

FINDINGS:

There is a small amount of fibroglandular tissue with minimal degree/intensity background enhancement.

Stable 5 mm enhancing mass in the right lower outer breast (image 71) is most in keeping with an intramammary node. Previously noted left central breast lesion is not enhancing today and is much less conspicuous.

There is a 5 mm round enhancing lesion in the right upper outer breast (image 75) with rapid early enhancement and washout. It is slightly T2 hyperintense.  It possibly represents an intramammary lymph node and may have been present in 2009
measuring 0.3 cm.  However, it is not seen on the 2008 MR images.

No adenopathy.

IMPRESSION: Possible right upper outer intramammary node (image 75).  Recommend correlation with targeted second look ultrasound. If not seen sonographically, MRI biopsy is recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: BRCA 2. LMP 8 years ago (TAH-BSO).

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison is made to prior imaging including an
MRI from 08/15/08.

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue which does not
show any significant enhancement.

LEFT: The previously described, mass in the lower inner quadrant
is stable (image 22). The smaller mass in the lower outer
quadrant is also stable. There are scattered other foci of
enhancement which are unchanged.

RIGHT: The linear parenchymal enhancement in the lower inner
quadrant (image 72) is unchanged. There has been interval
increase in the size of a focus of enhancement anterior to this
(image 69) which now measures 6 mm in diameter. There are no
masses.

There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

1. The previously described masses in the left breast are stable.
2. The linear enhancement in the right breast is stable.
3. There has been interval increase in a focus of enhancement in
the right breast (image 69). This is not likely to be seen on
ultrasound and therefore a biopsy under MR guidance is suggested.
A verbal report will be phoned to the requesting physician in
order to obtain the appropriate requisition.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI, RIGHT BREAST MRI

CLINICAL HISTORY: Family history of breast cancer. Hysterectomy
and salpingoophorectomy March 2000.

TECHNIQUE: Initial axial and coronal T 1 weighted gradient images
were obtained of both breasts. Sagittal 3D T 1 weighted images
pre and post gadolinium contrast were obtained through both
breasts followed by subtracted images of both breasts. The right
breast was followed with additional T 2 weighted fat saturation
FSE images and sagittal plain in addition to 2D gradient T 1
weighted sagittal images with fat sat pre and post gadolinium
contrast administration and 3D gradient T 1 weighted fat sat
images with T 1 weighted fat sat images.

FINDINGS:

There is minimal fibroglandular tissue throughout both breasts.
In the right breast, centrally in line with the nipple, at the
junction of the anterior and middle 1/3rd is a complex lesion
with an enhancing solid component at its inferior aspect and a
nonenhancing cystic component with high T 2 weighted signal in
the superior aspect. Total dimensions measure 1.0 x 0.7 cm with a
solid nodular component measuring 6.0 mm and the cystic component
measuring 4.0 mm. The lesion is located 3.2 cm deep to the
nipple. This solid component demonstrates early arterial enhancement
pattern with wash-out on delayed imaging which is
suspicious. There is an additional nodule at the 12 o'clock axis
located 5.9 cm from the nipple measuring 5.0 mm and enhancement
characteristics of more delayed enhancement with maintenance of
contrast enhancement on delayed imaging, typical of a benign
entity. In addition, there is a small bilobed cyst measuring 8.0
mm at the 2 o'clock axis anterior 1/3rd of the breast.

No evidence of suspicious enhancement in the left breast.

IMPRESSION

Suspicious lesion right breast, centrally, with the appearance
consistent with a complex cyst with enhancing mural nodule.
Enhancement pattern is suspicious. A targeted ultrasound was
unable to localize the abnormality. Therefore surgical excision
biopsy recommended after MR needle localization.

Lesion category assessment:

Right breast BIRADS: 4; Suspicious abnormality, biopsy
recommended.

Left breast BIRADS: 1; Negative.

FINDINGS: There is a mild amount of scattered fibroglandular
tissue throughout both breasts. No significant background
parenchymal enhancement.

RIGHT BREAST: In the lower right breast, at the previous scar
site, corresponding to the mammographic mass there is a large,
irregular, spiculated mass, centered in the lower inner quadrant,
extending into the lower outer quadrant involving anterior, middle
and posterior 1/3s of the breast measuring 3.1 x 5.3 x 6 cm (SI x
transverse x AP). Marked degree of rapid initial and washout
delayed enhancement. The mass extends to the skin but there is no
skin enhancement. The mass extends posteriorly to the pectoralis
fascia but no evidence of pectoralis or chest wall involvement.

Additional indeterminate enhancing foci in the upper right breast
measuring 5 mm (image 78 and 4 mm (image 73).

LEFT BREAST: Large, irregular, spiculated mass centered in the
outer left breast, 3 o'clock axis, extending into the upper and
outer quadrant and medially into the inner breast measures 3.3 x
4.5 x 7.2 cm (SI x transverse x AP). Marked degree of rapid
initial and washout delayed enhancement. The mass involves the
anterior, middle and posterior 1/3s of the breast. There is
clumped non-mass ductal enhancement extending to the immediate
subareolar region with associated nipple retraction. No evidence
of pectoralis or chest wall involvement. There is asymmetric
diffuse edema involving the skin and breast but no evidence of
skin enhancement.

AXILLA: 2 asymmetrically enhancing and morphologically abnormal
appearing level 1 left axillary lymph nodes. Both demonstrate
slightly more enhancement compared with the remaining nonenhancing
lymph nodes and eccentrically thickened cortices. No concerning
right axillary lymph nodes.

OPINION: Suspicious large bilateral breast masses suspected as
bilateral locally advanced breast cancer. Indeterminant left
axillary level 1 lymph nodes.

High risk screening study.

TECHNIQUE: Axial and coronal T 1 weighted gradient localizer
images were obtained. Sagittal 3D T 1 weighted gradient images
pre and post gadolinium contrast administration and subtracted
images of both breasts were obtained.

FINDINGS:

There is a marked amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts.

In the right breast in the anterior 1/3rd is a 4.0 mm enhancing
mass demonstrating suspicious enhancement characteristics of
early marked arterial enhancement with heterogeneous wash-out on
delayed imaging more marked centrally with a rim type enhancement
on most delayed imaging. This is located in the upper half of the
breast. It is difficult to give an exact location as during
positioning the nipple was displaced along the medial aspect of
the breast but is approximately at the 12 o'clock axis. No
evidence of additional suspicious foci of enhancement. There is
an additional circumscribed nodule in the upper inner quadrant
posterior 1/3rd image 7 of the first subtracted dynamic series
against the chest wall measuring 5.0 mm. This has a questionable
notch and demonstrated indeterminant enhancement characteristics
of continued maintenance of enhancement on delayed imaging. This
may represent a benign intramammary lymph node but further
evaluation with high resolution MRI is recommended. This is
located at approximately the 1 o'clock axis.

Post therapy scar centrally within the left breast. There is
focal enhancement centrally within the breast at the inferior
aspect of the lumpectomy scar, measuring 7.0 mm characterizes rim
enhancement. The dynamic enhancement pattern is indeterminate as
their is early enhancement which maintains enhancement on delayed
imaging without evidence of washout or increasing enhancement.
Favoured is fat necrosis given its proximity to the lumpectomy
site and the appearance. A 6 month follow-up left breast MR is
recommended to ensure stability.

IMPRESSION

Suspicious mass upper half of the right breast at approximately
12 o'clock axis. Further evaluation with a high resolution MR
followed by ultrasound guided core biopsy as this is visualized
on ultrasound is recommended. At the time of high resolution MR
the upper inner quadrant nodule will be assessed. Again this is
favoured as an intramammary lymph node.

Rim enhancement at the lumpectomy site in the left breast.
Favoured is fat necrosis. A follow-up left breast MR is
recommended in 6 months.

sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 6 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging dated 1/23/2008, 1/10/2007
and 1/19/2005.

FINDINGS: LMP: Jan 12, 2008. Day 13 of cycle.

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both breasts.
Moderate degree of moderate intensity diffuse stippled background
parenchymal enhancement, symmetrically throughout both breasts.
Bilateral subcentimeter scattered cysts in both breasts.

Stable bilateral benign appearing masses include left upper outer
quadrant (image 8) measuring 0.9 cm and right upper outer quadrant
(image 72) measuring 1.9 cm. There is no definite correlate to the
mammographically seen 5 mm cluster of calcifications located in
the upper outer quadrant left breast posteriorly.

No suspicious enhancement is noted bilaterally.

CONCLUSION: Fibrocystic breasts. Bilateral stable benign masses.
BI-RADS: 2

As there is no MRI correlate to the mammographic cluster of
calcifications in the left breast. Stereotactic guided biopsy is
recommended.

RIGHT BREAST MR

CLINICAL HISTORY: High risk screening study. Left mastectomy in
1995.

TECHNIQUE: Axial and coronal T 1 weighted gradient localizer
images were obtained of the right breast. Sagittal T 2 FSE with fat
saturation of the right breast, sagittal 3D gradient T 1 localizer
images pre and post gadolinium contrast administration of the
right breast were obtained. Post imaging subtracted images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: This is a baseline screening study.

FINDINGS:

There is a mild amount of fibroglandular tissue. There is clumped
nodular regional enhancement located in the retroareolar and lower
half of the breast. While this demonstrates mild enhancement on the
earliest imaging, increasing on delayed imaging, the appearance is
indeterminant. The remainder of the fibroglandular tissue
demonstrates only minimal enhancement in the central breast. No
evidence of enhancing mass. There are associated tiny cysts within
the regional enhancement in the lower half of the breast measuring
up to approximately 3.0 mm associated with thin rim enhancement
typical of small inflammatory cysts.

IMPRESSION:

Indeterminant clumped nodular regional enhancement. Further
evaluation with high resolution right breast MR imaging is
recommended.

Lesion category assessment:0; Needs further work-up.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL HISTORY: High risk screening study. For repeat study timed
to a different phase in the menstrual cycle.

TECHNIQUE: Axial and coronal T 1 weighted localizer images were
obtained of both breasts. Sagittal T 2 FSE with fat saturation,
sagittal 3D T 1 SPGR images pre and post gadolinium
administration were obtained. Post imaging subtraction images were
produced.

REFERENCE EXAM: 11/7/2003.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. Scattered cysts throughout both breasts. Marked bilateral
parenchymal enhancement as previously. The regional stippled
enhancement in the RLOQ has slightly decreased but still persists
without a focal concerning area of enhancement.

In the left breast, there is again diffuse stippled parenchymal
enhancement slightly decreased from previous. No change in rim
enhancing spiculated mass approximately 6:00 left breast measuring
1.2 x 1.4 cm. Irregular linear enhancement extends to the LIQ which
persists contiguous with the mass with these findings suspicious
for associated DCIS. The remaining background parenchymal
enhancement however, limits sensitivity for detection of extent of
disease but no additional quadrant is definitely involved. The
previously questioned clumped linear enhancement in upper half of
the breast now blends in with the background stippled parenchymal
enhancement.

IMPRESSION:

Biopsy proven invasive left breast carcinoma with MR findings
suspicous for surrounding DCIS extending into the LIQ. If breast
conserving surgery is opted for, wide surgical excision of the LIQ
immediately medial to the mass following ultrsound guided needle-
localization of the biopsied ultrasound visible mass is recommended.

No definite additional disease in either breast.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL HISTORY: High risk of screening study. BSO 2005. Left
lumpectomy (DCIS) February 2006.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on
a 1.5 T GE magnet. Localizer images, sagittal T2 FSE images with
fat saturation (TE:102, TR:4000), simultaneous sagittal, fat
suppressed TR interleaved T1 3D FSPGR (TE 4.2, TR:17.5, 28, 2.5 mm
slices, 2 minutes and 22sec/dynamic run, centric fill of k space)
pre- and 4 dynamic post IV gadolinium (0.1 mmol/kg bolus, 45 sec
delay) enhanced images were obtained of both breasts. Axial,
enhanced T1 weighted 3-D FSPGR, fat-suppressed images through both
breasts were then obtained. Post imaging processing includes
subtracted, MIP \T\ registration of subtracted imaging for
correction of misregistration due to motion artifact.

REFERENCE EXAM: January 4, 2006.

FINDINGS: Scattered fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Mild to
moderate degree of symmetric, stippled parenchymal enhancement,
slightly decreased from previous.

Interval resection of previous linear enhancement, corresponding
to DCIS lower inner quadrant left breast. There is now a seroma
in the lower breast at the surgical site with a thin concentric
rim of enhancement, mild early and persistent delayed typical of
granulation tissue. Stable benign appearing mass upper outer
quadrant (image 10) measuring 6 mm in keeping with a fibroadenoma.

Stable probable 5 mm fibroadenoma lower outer right breast (image
20). Resolution of prior linear enhancement lower right breast
related to previous physiologic enhancement.

No new or concerning abnormality in either breast.

Incidentally in the subcapsular region, segment 8 of the liver is
a heterogeneously minimally enhancing mass measuring 2.9 cm. In
retrospect this was present on the prior exam, less conspicuous
but likely unchanged in size. This may represent a benign
hemangioma but further characterization is necessary.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of malignancy. Returned to screening
recommended.

Incidental liver lesion which may represent a hemangioma.
Ultrasound characterization is recommended.

HIGH RESOLUTION LEFT BREAST MRI

CLINICAL HISTORY: Further evaluation of linear enhancement left
breast.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed with a dedicated breast coil on
a 1.5 T GE magnet. Localizer images, sagittal T2 weighted FSE fat
saturated images (TE:102. TR:3000), sagittal T1 weighted 2D FSPGR
fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:150, 14, 4 mm slices, 20 s/run) images,
3 pre and 11 post iv gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg, bolus
injection), sagittal 3D FSPGR fat saturated (TE:4.2, TR:50, 32, 1
mm slices, 6 min, 50 sec) images \T\ 3 dynamic runs of delayed
sagittal T1 weighted 2D FSPGR FS images as above were obtained on
the left breast.

REFERENCE EXAMS: January 4, 2006, mammogram same date and
comparison mammograms January 12, 2005.

FINDINGS: Scattered fibroglandular tissue throughout the left
breast. Moderate degree of background stippled and heterogeneous
multiple regions of enhancement, unchanged. The area in question
in the lower left breast, just medial to the nipple axis
proximally 630 is again identified measuring 2.1 cm (series 5,
images 11 to 18). This is characterized as heterogeneous
irregular linear enhancement, with moderate early and a persistent
delayed enhancement pattern. Correlating with mammography there
is a vague, stable asymmetry with a few calcifications 530-6
o'clock, middle to posterior 1/3 of the left breast.

No additional concerning enhancement.

IMPRESSION: Indeterminate to suspicious linear enhancement left
breast, requiring tissue sampling. Possible stable, mammographic
correlate. Further evaluation with additional mammographic views
and targeted ultrasound recommended. If a correlate is identified
at conventional imaging, biopsy recommended with clip placement.
If a definite correlate is not identified, MR vacuum assisted
biopsy then recommended.

CLINICAL INDICATION: 6 month follow-up of non-mass enhancement
left breast

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:

(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: June 2008

FINDINGS:

LMP: August 29th 2008

Large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally with moderate
background of parenchymal enhancement.

The previously described focal non-mass enhancement at 6 o'clock
is not seen on the current examination.

Stable 3 mm focus of enhancement left breast middle to posterior
third in the lower inner quadrant between 7 to 8 o'clock position,
(image 18).

On image 15, the 12 o'clock left breast, there is a circumscribed
well defined 7 mm mass which is hyperintense on T2 and shows
non-enhancing internal septations. It shows rapid initial
enhancement with plateau. It was present on the previous
examination but not as conspicuous probably because of the
background of parenchymal enhancement.

No abnormality right breast. No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

Stable focus of enhancement left breast lower inner quadrant.

Interval disappearance of the other non-mass enhancement left
breast.

Increased conspicuity of a mass left breast at 12 o'clock for
which targeted ultrasound of the left breast suggested. If not
seen on ultrasound, consideration should be given to an MRI guided
biopsy because the patient is BRCA 2 mutation carrier.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

Indication: High risk patient. Part of high risk screening study.

Positive family history of breast cancer.

Comparison: No previous MRI. Bilateral mammogram same date.

Findings: There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue
bilaterally with mild stippled background parenchymal enhancement.

Within the left breast there is a septated T2 bright lesion
measuring 8 mm (image 14) at six o'clock which exhibits mild
peripheral enhancement. This likely represents a cluster of
cysts.

In the right breast at one o'clock there is a T2 bright mass
(image 64) measuring 6 mm which exhibits mild spiculation of its
margins and early moderate and progressive enhancement on kinetic
curve analysis. Again, there is a background of stippled
enhancement.

The bilateral axillae are unremarkable.

Interpretation: 1. Morphologically suspicious enhancing lesion
within the right breast at one o'clock should be further assessed
with ultrasound. If visible on ultrasound, ultrasound-guided
biopsy is recommended. Otherwise, an MRI guided biopsy is
necessary. A verbal report will be called to the referring
physician.


2. Left T2 intense lesion is consistent with a cluster of cysts.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: High risk screening study. Postpartum June,
2008. Did not nurse. LMP January 23, 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 6
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium (Omniscan, gadodiamide) contrast was
administered at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec scan delay. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4,
TR: 8.3) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: None. Baseline.

FINDINGS: Mild amount of scattered fibroglandular tissue
throughout both breasts. No significant background parenchymal
enhancement.

In the right breast 6 o'clock periareolar region (image 35) there
is a 7 mm round mass, mildly heterogeneous internal enhancement,
moderate initial and areas of delayed washout enhancement. High
T2 signal and isointense T1 signal.

3 moderately enhancing additional foci in the lower and outer
quadrant right breast, largest measuring 3 mm include anterior
lower outer quadrant and posterior lower outer quadrant (image 37)
and lateral lower outer quadrant, middle 1/3 (image 39).

In the anterior 12 o'clock position left breast there is a 7 mm
round mass with smooth margins, isointense T1 signal and T2 dark
with a thin concentric rim of mild peripheral enhancement (image
18). This is favored as a complicated cyst, warranting further
evaluation.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: High risk screening study. Postpartum June,
2008. Did not nurse. LMP January 23, 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 6
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium (Omniscan, gadodiamide) contrast was
administered at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec scan delay. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4,
TR: 8.3) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: None. Baseline.

FINDINGS: Mild amount of scattered fibroglandular tissue
throughout both breasts. No significant background parenchymal
enhancement.

In the right breast 6 o'clock periareolar region (image 35) there
is a 7 mm round mass, mildly heterogeneous internal enhancement,
moderate initial and areas of delayed washout enhancement. High
T2 signal and isointense T1 signal.

3 moderately enhancing additional foci in the lower and outer
quadrant right breast, largest measuring 3 mm include anterior
lower outer quadrant and posterior lower outer quadrant (image 37)
and lateral lower outer quadrant, middle 1/3 (image 39).

In the anterior 12 o'clock position left breast there is a 7 mm
round mass with smooth margins, isointense T1 signal and T2 dark
with a thin concentric rim of mild peripheral enhancement (image
18). This is favored as a complicated cyst, warranting further
evaluation.

OPINION: Indeterminant mass 6 o'clock right breast warrants
biopsy. Additional mammographic views and ultrasound with view to
biopsy recommended. If not visible on mammography or ultrasound
MRI guided biopsy recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: family history of breast cancer

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 6 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral mammogram 2007

FINDINGS:

There is moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally.
Symmetrical background of parenchymal enhancement.

A few cysts are seen in the right breast. On image 64, there is
an irregular mass measuring approximately 6 millimeters, middle
third of the breast, which enhances rapidly initially with a
plateau on the delayed images. This is located centrally in the
right breast. No corresponding T2 signal.

No suspicious enhancement in the left breast.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.

IMPRESSION:

Indeterminate irregular 6 mm mass right breast for which targeted
ultrasound suggested. If not seen on ultrasound, MRI guided
biopsy is suggested.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Known malignancy at 9 o'clock right breast.
A questionable lesion at 7 o'clock

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral mammogram in right breast ultrasound of
06/02/2009

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Background
of stippled enhancement in both breasts.

There are multiple small cysts bilaterally not exceeding more than
1 cm.

In the right breast, there is a spiculated rapidly enhancing mass
with washout at 9 o'clock, middle third (image 73). It measures
9.4 by 13 mm. This corresponds to the known malignancy in the
right breast. It does not extend to the nipple areolar complex or
2 of the pectoralis muscle or chest wall. No other suspicious
mass seen particularly at the 7 o'clock position in the anterior
third where an abnormality was seen on ultrasound.

On image 15, in the left breast in the outer quadrant, middle
third, between 3 and 4 o'clock position is a 7 mm rim enhancing
mass. No corresponding T2 weighted signal. It shows progressive
delayed enhancement. It has probably benign characteristics.
IMPRESSION:

Only one lesion demonstrated in the right breast as described
above. The abnormality seen on ultrasound should still be
biopsied to exclude a second malignancy that can be occult on MRI.
(BI-RADS 6)

At the same time, targeted sonographic evaluation of the left
breast suggested to evaluate the lesion on image 15. If not seen,
follow-up MRI is suggested in 6 months. (BI-RADS 3)

76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images
(TE:3.7, TR:7.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast
were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2,
under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(6 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

COMPARISON: Multiple mammograms, most recent from March 2010. No
previous MRI done.

FINDINGS: Both the breasts have moderate amount of fibroglandular
tissue showing mild amount of moderate intensity enhancement.

LEFT BREAST: Multiple small scattered simple \T\ complicated cysts
noted in the lateral aspect of the left breast. No suspicious
enhancement seen.

RIGHT BREAST: Images 58-61 show a focal ill-defined area of
non-mass like enhancement measuring 2.1cm (AP) x 1.4cm
(superoinferior) x 0.9cm (transverse) in the superomedial quadrant
showing washout enhancement.
Image 72 shows a 5mm focus of washout enhancement which is bright
on T2 sequence.

No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy noted.
IMPRESSION: MR findings reveal a suspicious area of non-mass like
enhancement in the right superomedial quadrant.
We will call this patient back for targeted ultrasound of the
right breast and ultrasound guided core biopsy. If no sonographic
abnormality is noted then MR guided biopsy would be indicated.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: BRCA 2. High risk screening. LMP April 28,
2010.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: There are no prior MRIs for comparison.

FINDINGS:

There is a large amount of breast tissue showing a mild degree of
stippled background enhancement.

In the lower outer quadrant of the right breast there is a 17 x 16
mm focal, area of asymmetric non-mass enhancement which shows
progressive enhancement. There is a small, T2 bright, 3 mm mass
in the right outer breast, posterior third (image 64) which shows
rapid enhancement and washout and has a fatty hilum.

No abnormality is identified in the left breast.

There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

1. Focal, asymmetric, non mass enhancement in the right breast is
most likely parenchymal in origin. A 6 month follow-up MRI is
suggested targeted to the 2nd week of the menstrual cycle
menstrual cycle.
2. Small, mass in the posterior, outer, right breast is most
likely a small lymph node.

administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: Large amount breast tissue with a marked degree and
intensity of enhancement; this limits MRI sensitivity. There are
bilateral small cysts.

Right 6 o'clock anterior breast, corresponding to the mammographic
and sonographic mass, there are 2 adjacent round spiculated masses
with isointense signal on T1 and T2 with associated parenchymal
distortion. These show rapid and intense enhancement with washout
pattern.
 - dominant mass (image 68) :19 x 16 x 19 mm
 - satellite mass (image 67): 10 x 8 x 7 mm slightly anterior and
superior to the dominant mass.

No evidence of chest wall, nipple or skin invasion.

No other area of suspicious mass or enhancement in the right
breast or left breast.

Bilateral axillary nodes are slightly prominent, right 7 mm and
left 8 mm. Two 3 mm right inframammary nodes are noted,
nonspecific.

Liver right lobe central low density 1.3 cm lesion, nonspecific.
IMPRESSION:

1. Marked parenchymal enhancement limits MRI sensitivity. Right
6 o'clock suspicious mass as seen on ultrasound, with an adjacent
anterior satellite nodule. No other definite abnormality is seen
in either breast. Recommend ultrasound guided biopsy of both the
6 o'clock dominant mass and the 10 o'clock lesion seen only
sonographically. Please submit a requisition for this to our
department.

2. Bilateral prominent axillary lymph nodes. Recommend
ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration of the right nodes.
Recommend left axillary ultrasound (decision to aspirate will be
made after this has been performed). Small right internal mammary
lymph nodes are nonspecific.

3. Liver lesion, nonspecific. Liver ultrasound is recommended,
we will leave this to your office to arrange for the patient.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Known ADH LUOQ. Microcalcifications LUOQ.
Post biopsy clip inferior and medial to area of biopsied
calcifications. LMP 10 months ago.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:8.6) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.7, TR:7.8) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (5 cc) was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec. Axial Vibrant with GD Swap (TE:4.1, TR:
8.4) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.
Motion artifact degrades subtraction images and kinetic curves

REFERENCE EXAM: Left Mammogram of 3/5/09.

FINDINGS: There is a marked amount of fibroglandular tissue.
There is mild stippled background parenchymal enhancement
bilaterally. There are a few small cysts bilaterally. Post
biopsy clip signal void artifact is noted in the left breast
medially and slightly superior to the nipple line. No abnormal
enhancement is evident in the left upper outer quadrant in the
region of the known microcalcifications and previous core biopsy.
There are foci of enhancement bilaterally some of which have high
T2 signal. A probable fibroadenoma is present in the right lower
outer quadrant posteriorly image 72 measuring 7 mm in diameter.
It has a high T2 signal and a moderate early and persistent
delayed enhancement. Also in the right breast in the posterior
lower inner quadrant is a 7 mm focal area of enhancement showing
moderate early and delayed plateau enhancement. This is possibly
parenchymal. No abnormal axillary nodes are seen.
IMPRESSION: No suspicious MRI finding in the area of the
microcalcifications in the left upper outer quadrant. For wire
localization of the area of calcifications.

There is a probable fibroadenoma in the right lower outer quadrant
posteriorly and possible focal parenchymal enhancement RLIQ.

As there is no right mammogram for comparison, a right mammogram
and a targeted ultrasound in the right breast inferiorly are
requested . If no suspicious finding is seen then a follow-up MRI
is suggested in 6 months.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: For further evaluation. Right brown nipple
discharge, bilateral calcifications and right ultrasound findings
(please refer to the recent previous imaging work up). LMP
October 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: Large amount breast tissue, marked degree and intensity
enhancement; this limits MRI sensitivity. Small left breast
cysts.

LEFT BREAST: Lower outer 6 o'clock focal non mass enhancement
with no T2 bright signal, 18 x 9 x 11 mm (image 14). This does
not correspond to the mammographic calcifications.

RIGHT BREAST: On the pre-gadolinium T1 series, duct in the nipple
is not dilated but filled with T1 bright non enhancing material
extending to the lower inner quadrant. This ends in a focal area
of non mass enhancement with no T2 bright signal, 16 x 11 x 6 mm
(image 66). This does not correspond to mammographic
calcifications nor to sonographic lesions.

No suspicious lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: Background enhancement limits MRI sensitivity.

1. Left mammographic calcifications are not correlated on MRI.
Recommend magnification views for further evaluation.

2. Left lower outer non mass enhancement, possibly parenchymal.
Recommend second look ultrasound. If mammographic calcifications
are malignant, suggest MRI guided biopsy. If they are benign,
suggest 6 month MRI follow up.

3. Right duct extending to nipple filled with T1 bright
substance, possibly blood, and ending in a focal area of non mass
enhancement in the lower outer quadrant.
- Given the history of brown nipple discharge, recommend right
galactogram.
- Given the MRI enhancement, recommend second look breast
ultrasound.
- Given the ultrasound findings, recommend ultrasound guided core
biopsy of the lesions described in the 11 and 7 o'clock positions
(and specimen radiograph of the 11 o'clock sample). If these are
benign, recommend MRI guided biopsy of the enhancement.

Please submit requisitions for this to our department.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram of 12/04/2009

FINDINGS:

Large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Marked degree
and intensity of background parenchymal enhancement which limits
the sensitivity of the MRI.

Corresponding to the area of microcalcifications seen on the
mammogram, there are masses and non-mass linear/segmental clumped
enhancement between 2 and 6 o'clock position extending from the
nipple to the posterior third of the breast. This shows rapid
initial enhancement with washout. The area of disease measures
6.4 SI by 9.8 AP by 3.5 TV cm (images 13 to 19). The areas of
masslike enhancement are at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock and 6
o'clock. The 3 and 4 o'clock were seen on ultrasound. Taken into
account the marked background parenchymal enhancement, no other
suspicious areas of enhancement in the left breast.

In the right breast, image 55, there is a rapidly enhancing 5.6 mm
mass with plateau on the late phase. This is bright on T2. The
mass has smooth margins. It has the appearance of the either a
fibroadenoma or an intramammary lymph node. It is located in the
medial aspect of the right breast between 2 and 3 o'clock
position.

There are a few prominent nodes in the left axillary region as
seen on ultrasound but they do not seem to exceed 1 cm.
IMPRESSION:

1-Highly suspicious known mass linear/segmental clumped
enhancement associated with masses at 2, 3, 4 and 6 o'clock left
breast. Ultrasound guided core biopsy of the 4 o'clock mass
suggested. Ultrasound of 2 o'clock and 6 o'clock are also
suggested to determine if masses are visible on ultrasound because
they were not described on previous ultrasound. If visible, one
of the masses can also be biopsied under ultrasound. This may
have required two appointments.

2-Ultrasound guided FNA of one of the axillary lymph nodes also
suggested.

Please send appropriate requisitions to facilitate the biopsies.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram of 12/04/2009

FINDINGS:

Large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Marked degree
and intensity of background parenchymal enhancement which limits
the sensitivity of the MRI.

Corresponding to the area of microcalcifications seen on the
mammogram, there are masses and non-mass linear/segmental clumped
enhancement between 2 and 6 o'clock position extending from the
nipple to the posterior third of the breast. This shows rapid
initial enhancement with washout. The area of disease measures
6.4 SI by 9.8 AP by 3.5 TV cm (images 13 to 19). The areas of
masslike enhancement are at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock and 6
o'clock. The 3 and 4 o'clock were seen on ultrasound. Taken into
account the marked background parenchymal enhancement, no other
suspicious areas of enhancement in the left breast.

In the right breast, image 55, there is a rapidly enhancing 5.6 mm
mass with plateau on the late phase. This is bright on T2. The
mass has smooth margins. It has the appearance of the either a
fibroadenoma or an intramammary lymph node. It is located in the
medial aspect of the right breast between 2 and 3 o'clock
position.

There are a few prominent nodes in the left axillary region as
seen on ultrasound but they do not seem to exceed 1 cm.
IMPRESSION:

1-Highly suspicious known mass linear/segmental clumped
enhancement associated with masses at 2, 3, 4 and 6 o'clock left
breast. Ultrasound guided core biopsy of the 4 o'clock mass
suggested. Ultrasound of 2 o'clock and 6 o'clock are also
suggested to determine if masses are visible on ultrasound because
they were not described on previous ultrasound. If visible, one
of the masses can also be biopsied under ultrasound. This may
have required two appointments.

2-Ultrasound guided FNA of one of the axillary lymph nodes also
suggested.

Please send appropriate requisitions to facilitate the biopsies.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Probable multifocal left breast carcinoma on
imaging.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

LMP: Postmenopausal for 30 years.

REFERENCE EXAM: Ultrasound and mammograms June, 2010.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. Minimal degree and intensity of background stippled
parenchymal enhancement in both breasts.

MRI confirms the ultrasound and mammographic findings of a
suspicious abnormality in the outer half of the left breast.
There are 3 suspicious masses from 3 to 4 o'clock in the middle to
posterior 1/3 of the lateral breast as follows: 3 o'clock, middle
1/3 (image 12) measuring 1 cm and 2 adjacent masses at 4 o'clock
in the posterior 1/3 measuring 1.2 cm (image 14) and 1 cm (image
13) located just anterior. All 3 masses demonstrate marked degree
of rapid initial and heterogeneous washout delayed enhancement,
irregular spiculated margins. Located just infero-medial by 5 mm
to the 3 o'clock mass is a satellite enhancing focus measuring 4
mm. Clumped ductal enhancement extends between and beyond the
suspicious masses. Total dimensions of expected involvement are
4.2 x 2.1 x 6.8 cm (SI x transverse x AP).

No concerning abnormality in the right breast.

No concerning lymph nodes.

Nonspecific circumscribed T1 hypointense lesion in segment 8 of
the liver measures 1.1 cm, unchanged from CT of 2008 and confirmed
as a cyst on prior ultrasound.

OPINION: Probable multifocal breast carcinoma outer left breast,
suspected disease extent greater than on mammogram and ultrasound.
2 site ultrasound guided biopsy recommended.

Appointments will be arranged through the referring physician's
office.

REFERENCE EXAM: Right mammogram and ultrasound May 28, 2009.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. There is a marked degree of marked intensity background
diffuse heterogeneous and stippled diffuse parenchymal enhancement
symmetrically throughout both breasts. Innumerable cysts
scattered throughout both breasts, ranging in size from 1 to 2 mm
to 1.9 cm.

Corresponding to the area of mammographic architectural distortion
is a similar MRI finding of a spiculated mass with distortion in
the upper outer quadrant right breast measuring 3.1 x 3.1 x 4.3 cm
(SI x transverse x AP). The mass is composed of long spicules
without a discrete central nidus. Tiny scattered cysts associated
with the lesion along the spicules. The mass enhances similar to
the marked background parenchymal enhancement, marked degree of
rapid initial and plateau delayed enhancement.

Additional mass in the posterior upper inner quadrant left breast
(image 29), lobular in shape with smooth margins, low signal
internal septations, moderate initial and persistent delayed
enhancement (image 29) measuring 1.3 x 0 .8 cm.

No axillary lymphadenopathy.

OPINION: Spiculated mass with distortion upper outer quadrant
right breast with suspicious MRI and mammographic features.
Differential diagnosis is between a radial scar and a carcinoma.
Stereotactic biopsy has been recommended and arranged.

Marked degree of fibrocystic change throughout both breasts with
associated marked bilateral parenchymal enhancement, limiting MRI
sensitivity. Six-month follow-up MRI recommended due to the
innumerable probably benign enhancing foci.

Probable left breast fibroadenoma also for follow-up at the
six-month MRI.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 3.5 cm mass within the right upper outer
quadrant with suspicious anteriorly located micocalcifications and
prominent axillary lymph nodes. Assess extent of disease.

LMP: Estimated to be April 12-14.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 6 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.REFERENCE MRI EXAM: None.

FINDINGS:
Moderate volume of background fibroglandular parenchyma, of which
a mild degree demonstrates diffuse and stippled enhancement of
moderate intensity.

Within the upper outer aspect of the posterior right breast, there
is a large heterogeneous mass measuring 3.4 x 2.9 x 3.4 cm
(craniocaudal, AP, and transverse dimensions respectively). The
lesion corresponds to the known pathologically proven malignancy
and demonstrates a thick rind of heterogeneous peripheral
enhancement with central necrosis; surrounding T2
hyperintensity/edema is noted at its posterior aspect.

There is no MRI correlate to the suspicious microcalcifications
noted anterior to the mass on mammography, or to the vague
hypoechoic area just medial to the mass noted on ultrasound
examination.

No suspicious abnormal signal or enhancement within the left
breast.

There are bilateral prominent axillary lymph nodes, measuring up
to 1.0 cm in maximal dimensions with rounded morphology and no
central fatty hila. In addition, there is an asymmetric small
right internal mammary lymph node, measuring 4mm (image 64 on the
T1 axial sequence).

Note of a 1.2cm Hypointense liver lesion within segment 5, which
can be correlated with ultrasound.
IMPRESSION:
Large heterogeneous mass within the posterior upper outer right
breast, corresponding to the known malignancy. No MRI correlate
to the surrounding suspicious findings noted on mammography and
ultrasound. Specifically, the microcalcifications noted anterior
to the lesion could be further evaluated with vacuum assisted
stereotactic biopsy. A requisition would need to be sent. The
vague hypoechoic area noted medial to the mass on ultrasound
examination is described to be within a 1 cm radius and could be
resected for definitive analysis at the time of surgery.

gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

PREVIOUS: Outside bilateral mammogram from July 22 2010.

FINDINGS: Small amount breast tissue with mild degree/intensity
enhancement.

Right breast 6 o'clock posterior contains a round mass with
spiculated margins and an enhancing rim with washout and central
increasing enhancement; the central portion is T2 bright. Overall
this measures 2.2 AP x 2.0 CC x 2.4 TV cm and lies 9.9 cm from the
nipple (image 67). This abuts but does not invade the chest
wall/pectoralis major muscle. Extending anteriorly from the mass
is linear non mass enhancement which is T2 bright, measuring 3.6
AP x 1.2 CC x 0.9 TV cm, and ending 6.4 cm from the nipple (image
68). There is an additional focus of enhancement lying at the
anterior end of the linear enhancement measuring 0.5 cm and lying
4.4 cm anterior to the mass and 5.2 cm from the nipple (image 68).

Right upper outer middle third focus of non mass enhancement with
irregular margins, T2 bright signal and decreasing enhancement
over time, measuring 9 x 6 x 5 mm and lying 4.5 cm from the nipple
(image 78).

Left breast contains several small foci of enhancement with
associated T2 bright signal (these lesions are indicated with
arrows on series 21).

No significant lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right breast 6 o'clock mass, with anterior enhancement and a
small enhancing focus which is possibly a satellite lesion, all
suspicious for disease. Recommend right spot compression and
magnification views. Whole right breast and axilla ultrasound is
recommended, as well as ultrasound guided biopsy of the mass.
Please submit a requisition for this to our department.

2. Right upper outer focus of enhancement, nonspecific. If seen
by ultrasound, suggest ultrasound guided biopsy. If not, suggest
MRI guided biopsy. Please submit a requisition for this to our
department.

3. Left breast contains small foci of enhancement, likely benign
lymph nodes and/or fibroadenomas. Suggest whole breast
ultrasound. If not seen by ultrasound, recommend MRI follow up in
6 months.

If there is no additional report within 1 month, please contact
our department.

No significant lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right breast 6 o'clock mass, with anterior enhancement and a
small enhancing focus which is possibly a satellite lesion, all
suspicious for disease. Recommend right spot compression and
magnification views. Whole right breast and axilla ultrasound is
recommended, as well as ultrasound guided biopsy of the mass.
Please submit a requisition for this to our department.

2. Right upper outer focus of enhancement, nonspecific. If seen
by ultrasound, suggest ultrasound guided biopsy. If not, suggest
MRI guided biopsy. Please submit a requisition for this to our
department.

3. Left breast contains small foci of enhancement, likely benign
lymph nodes and/or fibroadenomas. Suggest whole breast
ultrasound. If not seen by ultrasound, recommend MRI follow up in
6 months.

If there is no additional report within 1 month, please contact
our department.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspicious mass in the left breast with skin
retraction. Called back from consultation for BIRADS 5 lesion in
the left breast. LMP 1985.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: There are no priors for comparison.

FINDINGS:

There is scattered fibroglandular tissue which shows no
significant background enhancement.

There is an irregular mass with spiculated margins in the outer
aspect of the left breast (image 12) at the level of the nipple.
It demonstrates rapid enhancement and washout and is high in
signal intensity on T2. There is a central area which does not
enhance likely due to necrosis. There is associated retraction of
the overlying skin.

No abnormality is identified in the right breast.

There is an enlarged lymph node in the left axilla measuring 2.6 x
1.6 cm and several, enhancing lymph nodes in the subpectoral
region.

Incidental note is made of a small amount of high signal intensity
in the right lung (image 64) on the post contrast images.

OPINION:

1. Highly suspicious mass in the left breast with abnormal Level
I and II lymph nodes. Biopsy under ultrasound or mammographic
guidance is suggested. I understand a left breast and axilla
ultrasound as well as ultrasound core biopsy of the mass and
ultrasound FNAB of the left axillary node have already been
requested at the time of the consult of 12/01/09.
2. High signal intensity in the right lung may be on the basis of
atelectasis. Correlation with chest x-ray or CT as clinically
indicated.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Locally advanced breast cancer

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Outside mammogram and ultrasound

FINDINGS:

Marked amount fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Moderate degree
in background parenchymal enhancement.

In the left breast, in the lower quadrant between 5 and 6 o'clock
position is a lobulated and spiculated heterogeneously enhancing
mass with central necrosis. The mass measures 3.5 by 3.6 by 3.1
cm(SI by AP by TV). It shows rapid initial enhancement with
plateau. It shows intermediate intensity on T2. Associated
satellite masses 7 and 1.8 cm anterior to the dominant mass
measuring 5 and 4 mm respectively. The dominant mass is located
in the middle third of the breast. No associated skin enhancement
or pectoralis muscle enhancement. There is scan retraction
overlying the mass. No other masses seen particularly in the
upper inner quadrant where a mass was described on ultrasound.

No suspicious mass right breast.

Left Level 1 lymph node with the thickened cortex measuring up to
9 mm.
No other suspicious lymph nodes seen.
IMPRESSION:

Highly suspicious mass for malignancy with 2 satellite masses
anteriorly left breast with at least one level 1 axillary lymph
nodes suspicious for metastatic involvement.

Targeted sonographic evaluation of the left breast and left axilla
is suggested with core biopsy of the breast mass and FNA of the
axillary lymph nodes suggested.

The appointments will be facilitated.

were obtained through the chest. Post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: mammograms and left ultrasound September 2008

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of scattered fibroglandular tissue with mild
degree and intensity scattered background enhancement. Multiple
small cysts particularly in superior central left breast.

Close to the nipple in the upper inner left breast image 25 there
is a 6 x 5 mm enhancing lobulated mass, slightly hyperintense T2
signal, rapid initial and washout delayed enhancement type 3
curve. The location near the nipple suggests a papilloma. Further
assessment with magnification mammograms and ultrasound
recommended.

In the upper outer left breast image 12 there is a 4 mm enhancing
focus, hyperintense on T2 with moderate initial and persistent
delayed enhancement likely benign.

In the lower inner right breast image 65 there is a 5 mm enhancing
focus that is probably parenchymal

Axillae unremarkable.

OPINION:

Enhancing mass close to left nipple and further assessment with
magnification left mammograms and ultrasound recommended.

Other small enhancing areas are probably benign and follow up MRI
in six months recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Left breast Ca 1 o'clock. Outside MRI
images describe three separate lesions around mass and left lower
outer left breast enhancement significance unknown

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic
runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using

3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post
processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D
reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No previous imaging available. Unfortunately,
even the patient's previous mammograms are not available at the
time of reporting.

FINDINGS:

Mild volume and degree of mild intensity background parenchymal
enhancement bilaterally.

RIGHT BREAST:

Three nonspecific areas of enhancement;

1) smooth, short segment linear enhancement, image 79, 0.6cm lower
outer quadrant.
2) T2 bright ovoid mass laterally in the right breast around 3
o'clock, image 80, 0.7cm, possibly tiny fibroadenoma, enhances
early and plateaus
3) Circumscribed lobulated mass upper outer breast, image 77, 0.7
x 0.5 x 0.5cm. Mass is hypervascular early and heterogeneously
enhances, with some areas progressively brightening with time, one
nodular region possibly washing out, possible fibroadenoma but
indeterminate.

LEFT BREAST:

There is a 1.8 x 1.6 x 2.1cm spiculated hypervascular mass in the
middle third of the left breast centrally along the posterior
nipple line. There is thin, smooth linear enhancement extending
directly from the mass anteriorly into the nipple which is
indeterminate but suspicious.

There is a large volume of associated hypervascular, clumped
linear non-mass enhancement in a segmental distribution in the
left lower outer quadrant, extending from the posterior third to
the anterior third of the breast, spanning an AP diameter of
approximately 8cm in length x 1.7cm in width, all lateral to the
known malignancy. Enhancement extends toward but not into the
nipple anteriorly, clear of chest wall posteriorly by
approximately 1cm.

No axillary adenopathy. Indeterminate 0.3cm internal mammary
node.
IMPRESSION:

I assume the patient has had outside mammograms, as none are
available on our system for correlation. Unfortunately, none were
found today in the film library.

Known left breast Ca centered along the posterior nipple line in
the middle third of the breast, BIRADS 6. Large area of
associated suspicious non-mass enhancement in the lower outer
quadrant. If clinically relevant, this can be sampled to prove
large volume of associated disease, BIRADS 5. Second look
ultrasound and correlation with mammography suggested.

Left breast nonspecific areas of enhancement. Favor these will
likely be benign, suggest correlation with second look ultrasound
and US bx (or MRI biopsy as needed) of largest lobulated lesion in
the right upper outer breast. BIRADS 4.

administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained. Kinetic curve analysis was performed.

REFERENCE EXAM: Multiple prior MRIs, most remote December, 2007
and most recent October, 2008. Most recent mammograms of October,
2008.

FINDINGS: The breasts are composed of mostly fibroglandular
tissue. Mild to moderate degree of moderate intensity symmetric
background stippled parenchymal enhancement symmetrically
throughout both breasts, unchanged from December, 2007. Small
cluster of cysts anterior upper inner quadrant left breast
measuring 5 mm.

At the site of previous non-mass enhancement in the posterior
lower outer quadrant right breast, approximately 7 o'clock
inferiorly there is now a small round mass with heterogeneous
internal enhancement (image 64) measuring 5 mm, minimally
increased in size from most recent previous and enhancing to a
greater degree. There is now a marked degree of rapid initial and
plateau delayed enhancement.

Signal void artifact from the clip placed at the time of prior MRI
guided biopsy is located just medial and cephalad to the lesion by
7 mm. The clip left at the time of prior ultrasound-guided biopsy
is quite lateral in the subcutaneous fat and anterior to the
lesion.

No additional new or concerning abnormality in either breast.

No concerning lymph nodes.

OPINION: Slight growth of small right breast mass, is concerning
for carcinoma. Reattempt at biopsy is recommended. Right
mammogram and ultrasound recommended with view to biopsy. If not
visible repeat MRI guided biopsy could be attempted. However
given change in appearance, even if results are negative would
recommend surgical excision biopsy, targeting the adjacent clip.
A verbal report will be called to the referring clinician's office
and appointments will be facilitated upon receipt of the
requisitions.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Mammographic architectural distortion benign
on stereotactic guided VAB Post hysterectomy

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:9.3) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (5 cc)was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant Delayed (TE:4,
TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.
Motion artefact degrades subtraction images.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammograms of 2010

FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense with a minimal
amount of stippled background parenchymal enhancement. There are
are a couple of small complicated cysts present. No suspicious
finding is seen in the left breast.

There is linear high T2 signal in the upper aspect of the right
breast near the signal void artifact from the post biopsy clip,
which is consistent with the previous biopsy. At the inferior
posterior end of this biopsy tract there is an irregular
heterogeneously enhancing 8 mm mass showing rapid early and
delayed plateau enhancement image 65. It has a slightly increased
T2 signal. Although this is possibly related to the biopsy, the
masslike appearance is of concern. The clip is not at the site
of this mass. No abnormal axillary nodes are seen.
IMPRESSION: Irregular enhancing mass in the right breast
posteriorly slightly lateral to the nipple line. An MRI guided
vacuum assisted biopsy is suggested. Appointment will be
facilitated through the referring physician's office as a
requisition is required.

were obtained through the chest. Post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained. Total contrast: 6.5 CC

LMP: May 2, 2010.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison is made to prior mammograms. There
are no prior MRIs for comparison.

FINDINGS:

There is a large amount of breast tissue which shows a moderate
degree and mild intensity of background stippled enhancement.
There are small cysts bilaterally.

In the right breast laterally 9-10 o'clock posterior third, there
is a collection of adjacent enhancing irregular masses and non
mass enhancement (image 69-75) involving an area which measures
3.2 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm (SI x AP x transverse). This would correlate
with the area of pleomorphic calcifications and possible obscured
mass on the recent mammograms. There is rapid enhancement and
washout. The enhancement extends posteriorly and is in close
approximation to the pectoralis but there is no involvement of the
chest wall. There is no involvement of the nipple areolar
complex.

There are no masses or areas of abnormal enhancement in the left
breast.

There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

Corresponding with the mammographic findings there is highly
suspicious abnormal mass and non mass enhancement lateral right
breast 9-10 o'clock position with maximum dimension 32 mm. There
is no evidence of chest wall or nipple areolar complex
involvement.

Assessment with additional right mammograms for the extent of the
calcifications and ultrasound of the right breast and axilla
recommended. At the time ultrasound guided biopsy can be obtained.
These appointments will be facilitated once we have requisitions
faxed to the department.

CLINICAL INDICATION: follow up probably benign mass 6 o'clock left
breast

LMP: May 5, 2009

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1

dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: MRI February 2008 and September 2008, previous
mammograms and ultrasound

FINDINGS: moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild
degree and intensity background enhancement. Several scattered
cysts noted.

In the left breast at 6 o'clock there is a 8.4 x 7.2 mm enhancing
mass which has increased in size 3 mm February 2008 but is
circumscribed. This has moderate T2 signal with rapid initial and
plateau delayed enhancement. Biopsy is now recommended.

In the central right breast in the line of the nipple image 81
there is an 8 mm area of non mass enhancement not seen previously,
no T2 signal. This has moderate initial and continuous delayed
enhancement and may be parenchymal similar to other areas that
have fluctuated since previous studies.

Axillae unremarkable.

Liver lesions again visualized and no gross change but these are
being evaluated by ultrasound and please refer to these reports.

OPINION: enlarging circumscribed mass at 6 o'clock left breast and
this has been seen by ultrasound and ultrasound guided biopsy
recommended. A requisition would need to be sent to the department
and the appointment will be facilitated. The enhancement in the
right breast is probably parenchymal and can be assessed with
ultrasound and if no finding then follow up MRI in six months
suggested. BI-RADS 4.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Left mammogram with suspicious density,
distortion and calcifications in 12 o'clock position. Post
menopausal.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.5, TR:7.1) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (6 cc) was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec. Axial Vibrant Gd delayed with FS (TE 2.8,
TR 5.7) and axial Vibrant with GD Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.3) were then
obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP
\T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram of Dec 15/08

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue. There is
negligible background parenchymal enhancement. No abnormal
enhancement is present in the right breast. In the left breast
from images 13 to 20 there is irregular mass and non-mass
enhancement from the subareolar region superiorly from the 11 to 1
o'clock positions. This measures approximately 23 mm in the AP
direction, 21 mm in the SI direction and 21 mm in the transverse
direction. This shows rapid early and delayed plateau
enhancement. No abnormal axillary nodes are seen. No involvement
of the nipple subareolar complex, skin or chest wall is seen.
IMPRESSION: The enhancement in the left breast superiorly is
suspicious of malignancy and is over 2 cm in maximum dimension and
greater in extent than the microcalcifications identified on the
mammogram. If this area is not identified on ultrasound then
stereotactic guided core biopsy is recommended.

administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of breast tissue with a mild
degree and moderate intensity of enhancement.

Left lower inner middle third slightly irregular enhancing mass
with T2 bright signal lying 2.6 cm from the nipple and measuring
1.2 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm (image 32). This shows early enhancement that
decreases over time. This corresponds to the mammographic and
sonographic mass at 8 o'clock. The second sonographic lesion at 2
o'clock is not correlated on MRI.

Right lateral posterior linear non mass enhancement along the edge
of the parenchyma with no T2 signal and with increasing
enhancement over time, measuring 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm (image 72).
Right upper outer fibroadenoma seen mammographically is not
correlated on MRI.

There is no suspicious lymphadenopathy.

There are multiple low signal lesions in the right liver lobe,
largest measures 2.1 cm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower inner breast mass as seen mammographically and
sonographically. The 2 o'clock mass seen sonographically is not
correlated on MRI. Recommend ultrasound guided core biopsy of both
masses. Please submit a requisition for this to our department.

2. Right non mass enhancement is likely benign. Recommend 6
month follow up MRI.

3. Indeterminate liver lesions, not characterized on this MRI.
They could be cysts. Recommend liver ultrasound for
characterization. We will leave this to your office to arrange.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Clinically palpable lump with mammographic
and sonographic imaging characteristics suggestive of a carcinoma
in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast. Ultrasound also
demonstrated an indeterminate right axillary node with mild (4mm)
eccentric thickening of the cortex. Further evaluation with MRI
recommended due to heterogeneously dense breast tissue.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

LMP: March 2009.

REFERENCE EXAM: No previous MRI for comparison. Correlation is
made with recent ultrasound and mammogram from October 22, 2009.

FINDINGS:

Mild amount of scattered fibroglandular tissue which exhibits a
mild degree of mild intensity background stippled enhancement
symmetrically throughout both breasts.

T2 images demonstrate a small (5mm) cyst in the lower outer
quadrant of the right breast. In addition, there is a
well-circumscribed oval lesion which is of homogeneous moderate T2
hyperintensity located in the right anterosuperior mediastinum
which measures 1.6 x 1.9cm.

There is a dominant lobulated mass with spiculated margins located
in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast measuring
approximately 2.1 x 2.9 x 2.3cm (CC x AP X TRV). The mass
demonstrates predominantly moderate hyperintense T2 signal with a
central area of relative decreased signal intensity. On the
gadolinium enhanced images the mass demonstrates rapid and marked
heterogeneous internal enhancement as well as strong
rim-enhancement, with washout seen on the delayed images.
Posteroinferior to the dominant mass is a smaller, satellite focus
measuring approximately 5mm, at a distance of 5 mm from the
dominant mass. Including this focus, the region of abnormality
measures approximately 3.6cm in AP dimension.

There is a small, lymph node identified in the right axillary
region, likely corresponding to the indeterminate node identified
on ultrasound. No concerning axillary lymph nodes on MRI.

In addition, there is an enhancing right internal mammary lymph
node which measures approximately 6mm in short-axis.

INTERPRETATION:

1. Dominant mass and adjacent satellite lesion in the upper inner
quadrant of the right breast with morphological and enhancement
characteristics that are highly concerning for invasive cancer.
Given the medial location of the mass, the presence of a prominent
ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node is also concerning for
metastatic spread. This mass has been previously characterized by
both mammography and ultrasound. As recommended previously
ultrasound guided biopsy recommended.

2. Well-circumscribed mass with high T2 hyperintensity and no
definite enhancement located in the right anterosuperior
mediastinum most likely representing a mediastinal cyst. Further
evaluation of this lesion with a dedicated MRI of the thorax is
recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Further evaluation of right upper outer
quadrant distortion and calcifications, prior to recommended core
biopsy.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained. Kinetic curve analysis was performed.

REFERENCE EXAM: Baseline mammograms March, 2009 and mammograms
and ultrasound April, 2009.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. No significant background parenchymal enhancement.

Occupying much of the upper outer quadrant, middle and posterior
1/3s of the right breast is asymmetric, abnormal heterogeneous and
clumped regional enhancement (images 70 to 77). The dimensions of
involvement are 3.4 x 3.4 x 3 cm (SI x transverse x AP). The most
lateral aspect is an irregular heterogeneously enhancing focal
area measuring 2.5 x 1.4 x 2.7 cm (image 76) with associated
distortion and corresponds to be sonographically identified mass
and area of distortion on the mammograms. Clumped linear
enhancement between this dominant area and a more medial located
clumped focal enhancing area at approximately 12:30-1 o'clock,
measuring 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm (image 70). This more medial area
corresponds to the mammographic suspicious macrocalcifications.
The abnormality demonstrates overall a mild to moderate degree of
enhancement, mild initial and persistent delayed enhancement. One
internal focus demonstrates moderate initial and plateau delayed
enhancement. No evidence of nipple or chest wall involvement. A
few internal scattered cysts in the vicinity, correlating to the
ultrasound findings.

There are 2 additional tiny enhancing foci including posteriorly 9
o'clock right breast (image 78) measuring 2 mm and upper outer
quadrant, middle 1/3 (image 75) measuring 3 mm.

In the posterior lateral left breast at 3 o'clock (image 12) is an
oval mass with smooth margins and low signal internal septations,
mild initial and persistent delayed enhancement measuring 7 mm,
isointense on T2 favored as a fibroadenoma. Additional 3 mm
enhancing focus central breast (image 17), moderate initial and
persistent delayed enhancement, with a small focus of fat on the
non-subtracted T1 weighted images, possible tiny intramammary
lymph node. Smooth mild linear enhancement anterior 9 o'clock
left breast (image 23) measuring 1 cm, mild initial and persistent
delayed enhancement.

No abnormal lymph nodes.

Nonenhancing circumscribed hepatic mass measuring 1 cm, bright T2
signal, probable cyst in segment 4/8.

OPINION: Indeterminant - suspicious regional non-mass lesion
involving much of the upper outer quadrant right breast,
corresponding to the area of microcalcifications on mammography
and distortion and sonographic mass.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Further evaluation of right upper outer
quadrant distortion and calcifications, prior to recommended core
biopsy.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained. Kinetic curve analysis was performed.

REFERENCE EXAM: Baseline mammograms March, 2009 and mammograms
and ultrasound April, 2009.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. No significant background parenchymal enhancement.

Occupying much of the upper outer quadrant, middle and posterior
1/3s of the right breast is asymmetric, abnormal heterogeneous and
clumped regional enhancement (images 70 to 77). The dimensions of
involvement are 3.4 x 3.4 x 3 cm (SI x transverse x AP). The most
lateral aspect is an irregular heterogeneously enhancing focal
area measuring 2.5 x 1.4 x 2.7 cm (image 76) with associated
distortion and corresponds to be sonographically identified mass
and area of distortion on the mammograms. Clumped linear
enhancement between this dominant area and a more medial located
clumped focal enhancing area at approximately 12:30-1 o'clock,
measuring 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm (image 70). This more medial area
corresponds to the mammographic suspicious macrocalcifications.
The abnormality demonstrates overall a mild to moderate degree of
enhancement, mild initial and persistent delayed enhancement. One
internal focus demonstrates moderate initial and plateau delayed
enhancement. No evidence of nipple or chest wall involvement. A
few internal scattered cysts in the vicinity, correlating to the
ultrasound findings.

There are 2 additional tiny enhancing foci including posteriorly 9
o'clock right breast (image 78) measuring 2 mm and upper outer
quadrant, middle 1/3 (image 75) measuring 3 mm.

In the posterior lateral left breast at 3 o'clock (image 12) is an
oval mass with smooth margins and low signal internal septations,
mild initial and persistent delayed enhancement measuring 7 mm,
isointense on T2 favored as a fibroadenoma. Additional 3 mm
enhancing focus central breast (image 17), moderate initial and
persistent delayed enhancement, with a small focus of fat on the
non-subtracted T1 weighted images, possible tiny intramammary
lymph node. Smooth mild linear enhancement anterior 9 o'clock
left breast (image 23) measuring 1 cm, mild initial and persistent
delayed enhancement.

No abnormal lymph nodes.

Nonenhancing circumscribed hepatic mass measuring 1 cm, bright T2
signal, probable cyst in segment 4/8.

OPINION: Indeterminant - suspicious regional non-mass lesion
involving much of the upper outer quadrant right breast,
corresponding to the area of microcalcifications on mammography
and distortion and sonographic mass.

Arrangements have been made for ultrasound and stereotactic guided
biopsies of both abnormalities.

Additional findings include probable fibroadenoma lateral left
breast and a few additional probably benign enhancing foci in both
breasts and probable linear parenchymal enhancement left breast.
Targeted ultrasound of the left breast 3 o'clock probable
fibroadenoma is recommended. If not sonographically visible,
six-month follow-up MRI of this and the additional probably
non-mass lesions recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Bilateral
calcifications and left upper inner thickening. Post menopausal.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging (from Scarborough Hospital).

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of breast tissue with a mild
degree and moderate intensity of enhancement. There are mild
bilateral post operative changes. A few small cysts are seen
bilaterally.

Left lower outer non mass segmental enhancement in a stippled
pattern with progressive enhancement which corresponds to the most
suspicious cluster of calcifications mammographically. This
measures 9.0 cm AP x 4.7 cm CC x 6.0 cm TV and does not extend to
the nipple (image 20).

Right central (slightly lateral) vague focal non mass enhancement,
calcifications are seen diffusely in the breast, also involving
this site. This measures 14 x 9 x 5 mm (image 80, 6.1 cm from the
nipple).

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower outer non mass segmental enhancement corresponding
to the most suspicious calcifications on the left.

2. Right central small area of non mass enhancement which could
be parenchymal.

3. Recommend left breast ultrasound and bilateral stereotactic
core biopsies, as per the consultation report.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 59yo, ADH on stereobiopsy of left lower outer
quadrant microcalcification. To assess extent of the disease. LMP
, 9 yrs ago.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No previous MRI available for comparison.

FINDINGS:

Scattered amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Minimal
stippled background parenchymal enhancement.
Bilateral breast cysts with the largest in the right posterior
central breast measuring 9mm.
No other focal abnormality or abnormal area of enhancement is seen
in the right breast.
In the left lower outer quadrant at 6 o'clock position (at the
site of previous biopsy), there is a focal area of non mass like
enhancement which appears bright on T2WI. No other areas of
abnormal enhancement or focal abnormality identified in the left
breast .
No size significant axillary lymph node .
IMPRESSION:
Area of bening non mass like enhancement in the left lower outer
quadrant corresponding to the previous site of biopsy.


BI-RADS: 4. At least 3 wires are recommended in the left lower
outer quadrant in the superior and inferior aspects to remove all
of the calcifications because of the diagnosis of ADH.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

Indication: Right breast biopsy August 2008 for
microcalcifications. Pathology reveals atypical lobular
hyperplasia. Biopsy site was right upper inner quadrant. LMP Oct
16/08

The MRI is ordered pre-surgical excision to exclude concurrent
disease.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
84, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.4, TR:6.9) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (7 cc) was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec. Axial Vibrant Gd delayed with FS (TE 2.8,
TR 5.7) and axial Vibrant with GD Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.3) were then
obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP
\T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison: No previous MRI. Ultrasound July 2008. Multiple
prior mammograms.

Findings: Breast tissue is heterogeneously dense with diffuse
hetereogenous and stippled enhancement of moderate degree and
intensity. Signal void artifact related to the post biopsy clip
is noted on image 57 in the right upper inner quadrant. High T1
signal pre-contrast ducts bilaterally.

There are multiple bilateral cysts. One of the larger cysts is
seen on the right (image 22) measuring 13.5 mm.

Multiple bilateral enhancing foci are seen as follows:
Left breast
1. Image 8, three o'clock middle third measuring 4 mm. This
lesion demonstrates high T2 with rapid early and mild washout
pattern. This could be a node.
2. Image 15, 12 o'clock posteriorly measuring 4 mm. This lesion
exhibits high T2 signal with rapid early and delayed plateau
pattern.

Right breast
1. Image 70, RUOQ posteriorly 6 mm round mass exhibiting washout
enhancement characteristics. This mass is intermediate to high
signal intensity on T2 with rapid early and delayed washout.
2. Image 73, RUOQ measuring approximately 7 mm. Oval-shaped
well-circumscribed mass with high T2 signal intensity. This
exhibits washout on dynamic imaging.

Site of biopsy right upper inner quadrant is seen, with mild
underlying architectural distortion and increased T2 signal.

Axillary lymph nodes are normal in appearance.

Interpretation: Fibrocystic parenchymal changes with multiple
enhancing foci and masses as described. These could be
fibroadenomata.

The right breast masses are morphologically benign in appearance,
however exhibit washout on dynamic imaging.

Targeted ultrasound is suggested of the RUOQ and left 3 \T\ 12
o'clock radii. If no ultrasound correlate is identified, MRI
guided vacuum assisted biopsy is suggested of the lesion in the
left 12 o'clock position and the lesion seen on the right image
70.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Patient with highly suspicious segmental
microcalcifications right breast

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:

FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram of August 21st 2008

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Significant
background of parenchymal enhancement both breast decreasing the
sensitivity of the examination. Multiple bilateral cysts.

Corresponding to the area of microcalcifications in the right
breast, there are areas of non mass segmental enhancement starting
in the lower inner quadrant at approximately 4 o'clock to 7
o'clock. The area of enhancement imply the middle and posterior
third of the right breast (images 61 to 74) the area measures 3
SI x 5.2 AP x 3.0 TR cm.

On images 70-71, there is a 5.3 mm area of enhancement which seems
to be irregular posteriorly. This is located approximately 2 cm
above the main area of enhancement in the middle third centrally
in the right breast approximately 5 cm deep to the nipple. No
definite corresponding abnormality on the mammogram in that area.
When the patient comes for her stereotactic biopsy, targeted
ultrasound is suggested of the area. If no abnormality seen on
ultrasound, and if conservative breast surgery is being
contemplated in this patient, MRI guided biopsy should be
considered.

No abnormality left breast.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

Area of microcalcifications on the mammogram corresponds to non
mass segmental enhancement on MRI. Extent of disease is well
depicted by mammogram except for one area on images 70-71 as
described above for which targeted ultrasound suggested. If not
seen on ultrasound, consideration should be given to MRI guided
biopsy of this foci if conservative surgery is contemplated in
this patient.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Right 10 and 7 o'clock suspicious nodules. No
personal or family history of breast cancer. LMP October 12 2009.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a large amount of breast tissue with a
moderate degree and intensity of enhancement. This limits MRI
sensitivity.

In the right lower outer middle third breast there is a spiculated
irregular mass with early enhancement that washes out, measuring
2.8 AP x 2.6 CC x 3.6 TV cm (5.8 cm from the nipple, image 68).
This corresponds to the sonographic 7 o'clock mass measuring 3.2 x
2.7 x 2.8 cm. Abnormal enhancement does not extend to the chest
wall or skin however there is asymmetric thickening of the skin of
the central breast on the right (6 mm thick versus 2 mm on the
left).

The sonographic 10 o'clock lesion is difficult to correlate on
MRI. There is an area of enhancement in the upper outer middle
third of the breast that is slightly more enhancing than the
background breast tissue however shows increasing enhancement over
time. It could correspond to the 10 o'clock mass, although it
occupies a larger volume. It measures 4.1 CC x 2.1 AP x 1.8 TV cm
(3.4 cm from nipple, image 74) (previous 2.1 x 1.2 x 1.6 cm). It
does not abut the skin or chest wall. It appears to connect to
the 7 o'clock mass.

No other abnormal right breast mass or enhancement is seen.

There is no abnormal mass or enhancement in the left breast.

There is no abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. MRI sensitivity is limited by background parenchymal
enhancement.

2. The right 7 o'clock mass on ultrasound corresponds to an MRI
mass.

3. The right 10 o'clock mass on ultrasound is more difficult to
see on MRI, a possible corresponding lesion on MRI is larger than
on ultrasound.

4. No abnormal lymph nodes or left breast mass.

5. Asymmetric right breast central skin thickening which is not
contiguous with either mass. Cannot exclude an inflammatory
component of malignancy. Suggest clinical correlation and could
consider skin punch biopsy.

6. As per ultrasound recommendation, ultrasound guided core
biopsies of the right 7 and 10 o'clock masses are recommended, as
is sampling of an axillary lymph node. Please submit a
requisition for this to our department.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Right upper outer calcifications for further
evaluation. Left mastectomy 2007 (ILC), right MRI guided biopsy
2007. Postmenopausal.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.6, TR:7.3) pre and 4 dynamic runs post

Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast ( cc)was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant with GD Swap
(TE:4, TR: 8.2) was then obtained. Post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison made to prior imaging. We have been
awaiting previous outside films but they have not arrived.

FINDINGS: Left mastectomy and TRAM flap reconstruction. No
abnormal mass or enhancement seen.

Right breast shows a small amount of breast tissue and mild degree
and intensity of enhancement.

Right 12 o'clock clip is noted with no surrounding abnormal mass
or enhancement.

Right upper outer calcifications show no MR correlate (no abnormal
mass or enhancement).

Right lower outer focal area of stippled non mass enhancement in
the middle third, measuring in total 2.5 cm AP x 2.1 cm CC x 1.9
cm TV (images 59-66) and lying 4.5 cm from the nipple. This is
composed of roughly 5 enhancing foci, only one with T2 bright
signal and all with plateauing type enhancement.

Note is made of a 2 mm right internal mammary lymph node,
nonspecific. No other abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. No abnormal mass/enhancement at the site of MRI clip or upper
outer calcifications. Recommend stereotactic core biopsy of right
calcifications. Please submit a requisition for this.

2. Right lower outer non mass enhancement, nonspecific.
Recommend second look ultrasound. If not seen by ultrasound,
recommend MRI guided biopsy (targeting the focus on image 65).
Please submit a requisition for this.

3. Nonspecific small right internal mammary lymph node.

4. Previous outside imaging has not arrived. If it is sent to
our department, we will dictate an addendum report.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Serous left nipple discharge. Ultrasound May
2008 demonstrated dilated branching duct system lower outer left
breast. At 4 o'clock 3 cm from the nipple lobulated 11 x 3 x 8 mm
hypoechoic mass which was biopsied and showed fragments of large
duct papilloma with no atypia. For assessment extent of disease
as other adjacent hypoechoic areas seen on ultrasound. No other
lesions on galactography. Family history breast carcinoma.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:8.1) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.6, TR:7.3) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus
injection. Axial Vibrant delayed with FS (TE:4, TR: 8.2) were then
obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP
\T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.


FINDINGS: Last menstrual period: 2.5 weeks ago. There is a
moderate amount of scattered fibroglandular tissue. There is a
moderate amount of scattered moderate intensity parenchymal
enhancement reducing the sensitivity of MRI.

Extending from the nipple into the lower outer left breast 4 to 5
o'clock position is a dilated high T2 signal fluid filled duct
system. Corresponding with the biopsied mass large duct papilloma
there is a 10 x 5 mm lobulated mass image 18 with rapid initial
and delayed plateau inhomogeneous enhancement. Small nodule
consistent with intramammary lymph node in upper outer quadrant
image 18.

In the inferior left breast (image 20) 6 o'clock there is a 6 mm
round enhancing mass with rapid initial and delayed plateau
enhancement that may correspond with the 2nd area seen medially on
ultrasound. Other areas of bilateral patchy enhancement are
probably parenchymal.

IMPRESSION: biopsy proven papillary lesion lower outer left
breast. Ultrasound guided pre-operative localization of this mass
and the adjacent hypoechoic areas recommended. Other patchy areas
of enhancement probably parenchymal and follow up MRI in six
months recommended (2nd week menstrual cycle).

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 48 year old female with new palpable lump in
the left retroareolar region. LMP 21 july 2010

COMPARISON: No previous MRI. Recent mammogram and ultrasound dated
22 July 2010.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR

(TE:3.7, TR:7.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast
were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2,
under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(8 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

FINDINGS: Both the breasts show mild amount of fibroglandular
tissue with mild background enhancement.

LEFT BREAST: There is a spiculated mass measuring 1.6cm (AP) x
1.7cm (superoinferior) x 1.6cm (transverse) noted in the upper
outer aspect of the left retroareolar region (anterior third image
14).
Immediately inferior to the above mass is another similar mass
measuring 1.1cm in diameter image 16.
The total superoinferior extent of the masses is 2.6cm.
Posterior to the lower mass is an area of linear non-mass like
enhancement images 13-14measuring 7cm (AP) x 1.8cm
(superoinferior) x 1.1cm (transverse). No involvement of the
pectoral muscle or chest wall noted.

RIGHT BREAST: shows a well-defined oval shaped mass in the middle
thirds of the 12 o'clock position measuring 6mm x 3mm in size
(image 67) showing plateau enhancement. No corresponding T2 bright
signal noted.
No other suspicious enhancement noted.

No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy noted.
IMPRESSION: MR findings reveal a likely malignant mass in the left
retroareolar region as described above.

We will call this patient back for ultrasound guided core biopsy
of the left retroareolar mass. At the same time an attempt will be
made to find a sonographic correlate to the right breast mass (at
12 o'clock location) for biopsy.
Spot compression views of the left breast will also be performed
to to evaluate the region corresponding to the non-mass like

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 49 years old with right breast skin
thickening and nipple inversion. Previous mammogram and ultrasound
from March/2009 demonstrated large right central mass with
spiculation and abnormal right axillary lymph nodes. MRI for
extent of the disease.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: To previous mammogram and ultrasound from
March/26/2009.

FINDINGS:
There is scattered amount of fibroglandular tissue with moderate
degree and intensity of background parenchymal enhancement.
In the right central breast (images 59-72), there is a large
enhancing spiculated mass the bulk of which is located in the
subareolar region measuring approximately 4.3 TV x 2.4 AP x 3.8 CC
cm which is approximately 2.2 cm from the nipple. The mass extends
to the right nipple causing nipple retraction and to the skin. It
aslo extends to the all four quadrants. No definite extension to
the right pectoralis muscle or chest wall.

There is subtle architectural distortion of the left subareolar
tissue with apparent tethering of the anterior and posterior
margins with subtle extension to the left nipple. No underlying
focal mass is seen.

There are several bilateral superficial and deep masses within the
breasts, both axilla and deep within the pectoralis major and
minor muscles. Some of these masses are enhancing and the other
are not. The largest on the right is located superficially in the
right axilla measuring 1.6 x 0.9 cm and on the left measures 1.3 x
0.8 cm located inferiorly in the breast. All of these masses have
corresponding high signal on T2 WI. We note that the patient is
known for neurofibromatosis type I and these bilateral masses are
most likely to represent neurofibromas. There is also a 2.1 x 1.2
cm right lower retrosternal mass anterior to the liver which most
likely to represent a neurofibroma give its distribution along the
intercostal dermatome (image 34 on axial).

There are abnormal right high and low axillary lymph node with the
largest measuring 1.3cm in the right lower axilla (image 49 on
axial).
IMPRESSION:
1.Right large central spiculated mass with extension to the
nipple, skin and the four quadrants as described above, in keeping
with a multicentric malignant process.
3.Abnormal enlarged right axillary lymph node.
As the right central mass and abnormal right axillary lymph nodes
were visualized on the ultrasound, ultrasound guided biopsy is
amenable as recommended previously.
3.subtle left subareolar region architectural distortion with
extension to the left nipple. Ultrasound correlation is
recommended.
Please submit a requisition for this to our department.
4.Bilateral superficial and deep masses, as described, most likely
to represent neurofibromas as part of the patient's known
neurofibromatosis syndrome.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspicious microcalcifications medial aspect
of right breast on mammography. Hysterectomy more than 15 years
ago.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.5, TR:7.1) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by injection at
2 cc/sec. Axial Vibrant Gd delayed with FS (TE 2.7, TR 5.6) and
axial Vibrant with GD Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.2) were then obtained.
Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D
reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram of 18/9/08

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue. There is a
moderate amount and intensity stippled background parenchymal
enhancement. There are a few small cysts bilaterally.

In the 12 o'clock position of the left breast middle third images
14-16 there is non-mass enhancement that has a moderate initial
and persistent delayed pattern which may be parenchymal.

In the area of microcalcifications in the right breast images 67
to 72 medial to the nipple line middle and posterior thirds there
is linear non-mass enhancement measuring approximately 63 mm in
the AP dimension and 26 mm in the SI direction. Within this there
is also a small heterogeneously enhancing mass image 69 measuring
6 mm in diameter. This mass shows rapid early and delayed
washout. On image 78 slightly lateral to the nipple line is in
irregular enhancing mass measuring 8 mm in diameter. It has
moderate initial and persistent delayed enhancement. No
suspicious enhancement is identified in the subareolar region in
the area of microcalcifications. There is a slightly prominent
lymph node in the right 9 o'clock position posteriorly image 82.
No other nodes of concern are seen.
IMPRESSION: There is abnormal non-mass enhancement in the area of
the microcalcifications in the medial aspect of the right breast
consistent with DCIS. Within this there is a suspicious mass
suggestive of invasive disease. Another indeterminate mass is
seen in the right nipple line.

Ultrasound evaluation of the area of non-mass enhancement in the
left breast is suggested. Ultrasound evaluation of entire right
breast, intramammary node and axilla is suggested. If ultrasound
is not detect a suspicious mass in the area of the
microcalcifications a stereotactic guided core biopsy of
microcalcifications is recommended. Fine needle aspiration of any
abnormal nodes may be required.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: follow up enhancing mass lower inner left
breast first identified August 2008 in investigation progressive
thickening superior left breast. No ultrasound correlate. Post
menopausal.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:August 2008 MRI and Bilateral mammograms June 2008

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular disease with minimal background
enhancement. In the lower inner quadrant left breast image 24
there is a stable enhancing mass, hyperintense on T2. This
measures 10 AP x 4 SI x 5 TV mm and shows moderate early and
persistent delayed enhancement. This is very likely a
fibroadenoma.

No new areas of enhancement.

OPINION: No suspicious findings. No change benign appearing
enhancing mass lower inner left breast. Further follow up MRI in
one year suggested.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 58 yo ,family history of breast cancer.
Previous right lateral breast biopsies in 1997 and 2004, pathology
was bening (papilloma). LMP in 1995. screening MRI.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Prior mammogram Sep/2008 and ultrasound 2007.

FINDINGS:
Motion artifacts degrading quality of the images.
The breasts consist mainly of fibroglandular tissue. No
significant background parenchymal enhancement.
No suspicious abnormality in the left breast.
Post surgical changes in the right lateral breast from the
previous biopsies. In the lower inner quadrant posteriorly (image
67) , there is a well defined smoothly marginated rim enhancing
mass measuring 0.7 TV x0.6 AP x0.7 CC with an intermediate T2 WI
signal. It demonstrates moderate initial and delayed wash out
enhancement. This is most likely to represent a small lymph node.
No size significant axillary lymph node.
IMPRESSION:
Small benign appearing rim enhancing mass in the right lower inner
quadrant ,as described, most likely a lymph node. However, given
its atypical intermediate signal on T2 , further evaluation with a
targeted right breast ultrasound is recommended. The patient will
be recalled for that.If sonographically occult, six months MRI
follow up is suggested.
Post surgical changes in the right lateral breast.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Baseline study. Family history of breast
cancer, risk 25%.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 6 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging (mammograms and ultrasound).

FINDINGS: LMP:01/04/2009; Day 14 of cycle.

There is moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally with
mild degree and intensity of diffuse and stippled background
enhancement.

Right breast: No suspicious enhancement is noted.

Left breast: There is a band of segmental non-mass enhancement in
the lower and outer quadrant, predominantly mid to posterior third
with dilated ducts within. It corresponds to the fibroglandular
density on the recent Mammogram. There is an enhancing oval mass
within this enhancing tissue and around the dilated ducts in the
mid third with no corresponding T2 signal. The enhancing mass
measures 0.6 x 1.0 cm and demonstrated rapid initial with deloayed
palteau pattern.

No adenopathy.
IMPRESSION:
Segmental non-mass enhancement in the left lower and lower
quadrant with an enhancing mass in close proximity to dilated
ducts.

Suggested targeted ultrasound to rule out underlying papillary
lesion, if there is concomitant nipple discharge, a galactogram is
recommended.

If the enhancing mass has an ultrasound correlate and is not an
intracystic or intraductal lesion, ultrasound guided biopsy is
recommended.

If there is no ultrasound correlate, MR guided biopsy is then
recommended.

We will facilitate the appointments.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Previous left lumpectomy for LCIS. Suspicion
of multicentric disease in the right breast. LMP Aug 9/10

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:7.9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1

(TE:3.7, TR:7.43 pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast
were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2,
under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(7 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram and ultrasound of Aug/10

FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense with a moderate
amount of moderate to marked intensity diffuse and stippled
background parenchymal enhancement. There are cysts bilaterally.
No suspicious enhancement is seen in the left breast.

On the right there are multiple (4+) irregular enhancing masses in
the superior aspect of the breast extending from image 59 to image
74 for a transverse diameter involving both the medial and lateral
quadrants of about 5 cm. These multiple masses show rapid early
and delayed washout enhancement with no associated increased T2
signal. The combined AP and SI diameters are approximately 3 cm.
In addition in the inferior aspect of the right breast there is
asymmetric linear segmental non-mass enhancement image 70
extending for an AP diameter of approximately 4 centimeters and a
transverse diameter of 1.4 cm. No abnormal axillary nodes are
seen.
IMPRESSION: No lesion seen in the left breast. Multiple masses in
medial and lateral quadrants of the superior aspect of the right
breast are suspicious of multifocal disease. In addition the
non-mass enhancement in the inferior aspect of the right breast is
concerning for DCIS. This area should be further evaluated with
ultrasound and biopsied if a correlate is seen. If breast
conservation surgery is contemplated and there is no ultrasound
correlate, MRI guided biopsy could be requested.

Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of one of the suspicious
masses in the upper aspect of the right breast has been
recommended as well as fine needle aspiration of the axillary node
with eccentrically thickened cortex. These will be facilitated.

breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

LMP: Subtotal hysterectomy 22 years ago. On Estrace since 2001.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammograms and ultrasound February, 2010.

FINDINGS: Breasts are composed of mostly fibroglandular tissue.
There is a moderate degree of moderate to marked intensity diffuse
background stippled parenchymal enhancement symmetrically
throughout both breasts, which limits sensitivity. There are a
few scattered cysts in both breasts, asymmetrically more marked on
the left, largest 6 o'clock measuring 6 mm.

LEFT BREAST: There are 2 probably benign masses, both with mildly
bright T2 signal including:
1) oval with smooth margins in the lower central, posterior breast
(image 14) measuring 6 mm. Marked degree of rapid initial and
plateau delayed enhancement, and
2) round mass with smooth margins posterior upper inner quadrant
(image 24) measuring 4 mm with a moderate degree of enhancement
including moderate initial and plateau delayed.

RIGHT BREAST: 2 probably benign masses, isointense on T2 imaging
as follows:
1) posterior central (image 63), lobulated with smooth margins,
measuring 5 mm. Moderate degree of enhancement including moderate
initial and plateau delayed enhancement. Suspect low signal
internal septations and
2) anterior central breast (images 64 and 65) measuring 8 mm,
lobulated shape with smooth margins, marked agree of rapid initial
and plateau delayed enhancement. Low signal internal septations.

No abnormal lymph nodes.

OPINION: No definite evidence of malignancy. Background
parenchymal enhancement limits MRI sensitivity.

Probably benign bilateral subcentimeter breast masses. Ultrasound
evaluation of both breasts is recommended in attempt to identify
the masses for purpose of follow-up. If not sonographically
visible, recommend 6 month follow MRI with the patient off
estrogen replacement therapy for 2 to 3 months prior to the
examination.

A verbal report will be called to the referring clinician's office
and the appointment for the ultrasound will be arranged upon
receipt of the requisition.

lobulated shape with smooth margins, marked agree of rapid initial
and plateau delayed enhancement. Low signal internal septations.

No abnormal lymph nodes.

OPINION: No definite evidence of malignancy. Background
parenchymal enhancement limits MRI sensitivity.

Probably benign bilateral subcentimeter breast masses. Ultrasound
evaluation of both breasts is recommended in attempt to identify
the masses for purpose of follow-up. If not sonographically
visible, recommend 6 month follow MRI with the patient off
estrogen replacement therapy for 2 to 3 months prior to the
examination.

A verbal report will be called to the referring clinician's office
and the appointment for the ultrasound will be arranged upon
receipt of the requisition.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Screening. Mother had bilateral DCIS at age
38. LMP August 19 2009.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 6 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a large amount of breast tissue with a marked
degree and intensity of enhancement. This limits MRI sensitivity.

Right central breast oval well defined mass with internal
heterogeneous signal, heterogeneous enhancement which increased
over time, internal non enhancing septations, and with associated
T2 bright signal; this measures 0.9 x 0.7 cm and lies 6.2 cm from
the nipple. This is most in keeping with a fibroadenoma.

Left central breast cluster of 3 small masses which show slightly
increased arterial phase enhancement compared to the background
parenchyma but with no associated T2 bright signal; in total these
measure 2.8 x 1.2 cm with the largest measuring 1.0 cm and all
lying 1.9 cm from the nipple (image 13).

Left lower inner mass with slowing increasing enhancement and with
no associated T2 bright signal; this measures 0.8 x 0.4 cm and
lies 5.6 cm from the nipple (image 23).

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: Right probable fibroadenoma central breast. Left
central masses which are indeterminate. Left lower inner mass
which is likely parenchyma. MRI sensitivity is limited by
background parenchymal enhancement.

Recommend bilateral MLO mammograms to exclude developing mass or
calcifications. Recommend bilateral targeted ultrasound. If not
seen by ultrasound, recommend MRI guided biopsy of the largest
mass in the left central breast and 6 month follow up MRI of the
other masses.

Please send requisitions for these examinations.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Recent left breast ultrasound guided core
biopsy, ALH on pathology.

LMP: Postmenopausal.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammograms and ultrasound August and September,
2009.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. There are scattered cysts in both breasts including some
rim enhancing inflamed cysts, largest in the subareolar region,
middle 1/3 left breast measuring 1.3 cm. There is a mild amount
of moderate intensity background symmetric stippled parenchymal
enhancement in both breasts.

In the central left breast anterior 1/3 is heterogeneous ductal
enhancement, demonstrating a marked degree of rapid initial and
plateau delayed enhancement measuring at least 2.4 cm (image 23,
seen on images 22-24).

In the lower inner quadrant, middle 1/3 right breast (image 68) is
clumped linear enhancement measuring 2.1 cm, demonstrating a
marked degree of rapid initial and plateau delayed enhancement.

No concerning axillary lymph nodes.

OPINION: Bilateral mammographically occult, indeterminant non-mass
enhancing lesions warrant biopsy. These are unlikely to be
visible with ultrasound. Bilateral MRI guided biopsy is
recommended.

Given the locations in the breasts, appointments for 2 different
days will be required.

A verbal report will be called to the referring clinician's office
and appointments will be arranged upon receipt of the
requisitions.

INDICATION: Left upper outer calcifications, with core biopsy of
atypia (performed elsewhere). For evaluation of adjacent
calcifications and left 4 o'clock sonographic mass. LMP: 9/4/10.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

Compared to previous imaging. This is patient's first breast MRI.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount breast tissue with moderate
degree/intensity enhancement; this limits MRI sensitivity.

Left lateral breast contains several small nodules which are T2
bright and likely intramammary lymph nodes (images 9, 11).

Left upper outer anterior post biopsy clip (image 15). Lying 1.1
cm anterior and inferior to the clip is a nodule which corresponds
to the site of mammographic calcifications. This is mildly T2
bright and shows washout of contrast, measuring 7 x 6 x 6 mm, 3.1
cm from the nipple.

Left 4 o'clock nodule on ultrasound is not correlated on MRI.

Left lower inner anterior dermal nodule which is T1 and T2 bright
and shows increasing enhancement over time, 8 x 8 x 5 mm (image
25).

Right medial breast contains small nodules which are T2 bright and
likely intramammary lymph nodes (images 54, 59).

Right lower inner anterior breast contains 2 nodules which are T2
bright and show plateauing enhancement. The more medial nodule
measures 7 x 6 x 7 mm (image 62) while the more lateral nodule
measures 6 x 5 x 5 mm (image 65).

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: MRI sensitivity limited by background parenchymal
enhancement.

1. Left upper outer nodule corresponding to the mammographic
calcifications. Stereotactic core biopsy is recommended.

2. Left 4 o'clock sonographic nodule is not correlated on MRI.
Ultrasound core biopsy is recommended.

3. Bilateral tiny nodules as described above are likely benign.
Follow up MRI in 6 months is recommended.

4. Left lower inner anterior dermal nodule is likely benign.
Clinical correlation is recommended. This can be further assessed
at the time of follow up MRI.

Please submit requisitions for these to our department. If there
is no additional report within 1 month, please contact our
department.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram and ultrasound of 08/26/2009

FINDINGS:

The breasts are mostly fatty. No significant background of
parenchymal enhancement.

Corresponding to the mammographic and sonographic abnormality, the
largest spiculated mass is seen in the anterior third of the left
breast in the upper inner quadrant. It measures 13 x 10 mm (image
30). It shows a rapid initial enhancement with washout. 10 mm
inferior to the dominant mass is a smaller nodular area of
enhancement. It measures 4 mm. 13 mm lateral and 25 mm posterior
to the dominant mass is a third rapidly enhancing one (image 27)
measuring 6 mm. The other masses described on the ultrasound
particularly at 2 o'clock, 4 cm from the nipple and 1 o'clock 5 cm
from the nipple were not confirmed. Area of disease therefore
measures 2.4 (SI) by 4 .4 (AP)by 1.9 (TR) cm

No abnormality left breast.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

Multifocal disease limited to the left upper inner quadrant.
Ultrasound guided core biopsy of the dominant mass can be done.

So please send appropriate requisitions to facilitate the
biopsies.

A verbal report will be called to the referring physician.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammograms February, March, 2010.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. Mild degree of moderate intensity background diffusely
distributed stippled parenchymal enhancement slightly
asymmetrically more marked in the left breast.

In the lower outer quadrant left breast middle 1/3 there is
non-mass ductal enhancement, clumped and heterogeneous,
corresponding to the mammographic calcifications measuring 2.3 by
1.1 x 3.7 cm (SI x transverse x AP), images 10 to 15. The lesion
demonstrates a marked degree of enhancement including rapid
initial and plateau delayed enhancement. Disease extent similar,
only slightly greater than that seen on mammography.

This was seen previously, at which time a targeted ultrasound had
been performed which correlated this lesion to an intramammary
node. It has undergone interval growth, is more rounded, and
heterogeneously enhancing, now suspicious on MRI, today measuring
0.7 x 0.5 by 0.9 cm, previously 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. It is
hypervascular with early enhancement and delayed washout.

No other concerning enhancement in either breast. No adenopathy.


OPINION:

Left upper outer quadrant enlarging hypervascular mass has
changed, become more heterogeneous and has enlarged. It no longer
has MR appearance of an intramammary node and has become
suspicious on MR imaging. A second look ultrasound is suggested.
If there is not a suspicious mass visualized sonographically for
biopsy, then an MRI guided biopsy is suggested. BIRADS 4c

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Locally advanced breast cancer. Assess
extent of disease

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Outside mammograms of June 2008

FINDINGS:

There is moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally.
Moderate degree and intensity of background parenchymal
enhancement.

In the left breast, in the upper outer quadrant is a rapidly rim
enhancing heterogeneous irregular mass measuring 18 by 24 by 23 mm
width and washout on delayed images. It is hypointense on T2.
There is skin thickening and edema on T2 weighted images
suggestive of an inflammatory component. The mass is not
extending to the pectoralis muscle or to the skin and is located
in the middle third of the breast between 2 and 3 o'clock
position.
There is an intramammary lymph node in the left upper outer
quadrant likely corresponding to the mass described on the
mammogram. It measures 7 mm.

No abnormality of right breast.

There are extensive axillary lymph nodes which imply all 3 levels,
level 1 and 2 and 3. The largest axillary lymph node measures 3.3
x 1.7 cm This is located in the lower axillary region. In the
superior portion of the axilla, just inferior to the subclavian
vessels are multiple lymph nodes which extends from level 1 to
level 3 contiguously.


IMPRESSION:

Locally advanced left breast cancer with inflammatory component
and very large axillary lymph nodes with a breast primary
measuring 2.5 cm in its greatest diameter.

HISTORY: bloody left nipple discharge. Mammograms and ultrasound
findings suspicious for malignancy medial left breast 8 o'clock 5
cm from nipple with suspicious low axillary lymph node. Other
sonographic findings closer to nipple including 5-6 o'clock may
indicate DCIS. Unsuccessful ductogram.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet with a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was
obtained through the chest. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images. Kinetic curves
were obtained. TOTAL CONTRAST: 7 CC Gadovist

LMP: post menopausal

REFERENCE EXAM: mammograms and ultrasound August 2010.

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue with mild
degree of moderate intensity scattered background enhancement.

Corresponding to the suspicious mammographic/ultrasound mass at
the 8-9 o'clock position medial left breast, images 25-28, there
is an irregular enhancing mass 13 SI x 12 AP x 10 TV mm. This
shows rapid early enhancement with delayed washout enhancement ie
type III curve. No involvement skin or chest wall.

In the subareolar area there are some small areas of non mass
enhancement which may correspond to US findings. In addition at 12
o'clock anterior third breast, image 14, is a 5 mm focus showing
rapid initial and delayed washout.

The abnormal appearing left low axillary node seen on US is also
seen on the axial MR image 45 with no other abnormal appearing
nodes.

Just medial to the right nipple, at 3 o'clock, image 70, in the
anterior third of the breast there is a 5 mm focus of enhancement,
query parenchymal.

SUMMARY: highly suspicious mass medial left breast with suspicious
level I node and US biopsies recommended.

Areas of non mass enhancement left subareolar area may correspond
to US findings and US guided biopsy of most prominent area 5-6
o'clock recommended.

A focus of enhancement left breast at 12 o'clock, image 14, should
be re-evaluated on US. If no US finding then repeat assessment
with MRI in six months recommended. Similarly US assessment of the
focus in the right breast at 3 o'clock recommended and if no
correlate MRI follow up in six months recommended.

On the same day but prior to these biopsies the galactogram should
be attempted again as this may be helpful in showing extent of
disease.

These procedures will be facilitated once we have the appropriate
requisitions for left ductogram, US core biopsies (at least 2
sites) left breast, FNAB left axilla as well US assessment right
breast with possible biopsy.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Left upper inner mass with calcifications,
for extent of disease.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 6 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of breast tissue with nodular high
degree and intensity of enhancement, this markedly limits MRI
sensitivity.

Corresponding to the mammographic/sonographic mass in the left
upper inner quadrant posterior breast is a 8 x 5 mm enhancing
irregular mass with rapid early and decreasing enhancement over
time (image 18).

No other obvious mass or abnormal lymphadenopathy is seen.

IMPRESSION: Background enhancement markedly limits MRI
sensitivity, the left upper inner quadrant suspicious mass is
again seen. Recommend ultrasound guided biopsy of this mass as
well as one of the left upper outer quadrant masses (seen
sonographically) and fine needle aspiration of the left axillary
lymph node (seen sonographically). A verbal report will be sent
and an appointment facilitated.

2 cc/sec. Axial Vibrant Gd delayed with FS (TE 2.8, TR 5.7) and
axial Vibrant with GD Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.2) were then obtained.
Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D
reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammography and ultrasound from November 2008.

FINDINGS:

The breasts are dense. There is a moderate amount of background
parenchymal enhancement. At the 12 o'clock position in the right
breast there is a spiculated enhancing mass. There are some
satellite enhancing foci just superior to this. The
superior-inferior extent of this, if including the enhancing
satellite foci is 2.8 cm, and the anterior-posterior extent is
approximately 1.5 cm. In the region of the microcalcifications
visualize on the mammogram, there is no MRI abnormality.

No abnormality visualized within left breast. No abnormal
lymphadenopathy visualized.
IMPRESSION:

Highly suspicious lesion at the 12 o'clock position of the right
breast, as described above. This will be biopsied under
ultrasound.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:

FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram and ultrasound of June 2009

FINDINGS:

Marked amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Marked
background parenchymal enhancement which decreases the sensitivity
of the examination.

In the left breast, in the lower outer quadrant, middle third,
between 5 and 6 o'clock position is a 7 mm heterogeneous rim
enhancing mass with cystic portion (image 16). It shows a rapid
initial enhancement with plateau (type 2 curve). It most likely
corresponds to the mass seen on the mammogram, ultrasound and to
the mass that was biopsied under ultrasound guidance.

No other areas of enhancement in either breast.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

Left breast heterogeneous mass as described above. The ultrasound
guided biopsy was discordant. I suggest that the patient has a
galactogram because of the nipple discharge. If the needle biopsy
is to be repeated, consideration should be given to an MRI vacuum
assisted guided biopsy. The decision should be made after the
ductogram.

A verbal report will be called to the referring physician.

Please send appropriate requisition to schedule the ductogram.

CLINICAL INDICATION: 72 years old, increasing right lateral
breast asymmetry suspicious for malignancy. Had FNA at an outside
institution, pathology is suggestive of angiolipoma. Questionable
angiosarcoma. Menopausal.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a

dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No prior MRI available for comparison. Two views
of right breast outside mammogram are only available.

FINDINGS:
There is scattered amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild
degree and intensity of multiregional background parenchymal
enhancement.
In the right lateral lower breast, there are susceptibility
artifacts most likely related to previous biopsy. Within this
area,there is large heterogenous segmental non mass enhancement
extending to the nipple. This measures approximately 7.4 AP x 3 CC
x 1.4 TV cm. There is also extension of this medially at
approximately 5 O'clock position. The overall parenchymal
involvement spans from 7 to 12 O'clock position.
In image 79 and 80, there are two small oval shaped enhancing
masses with probably non enhancing septation measuring 5 and 7 mm
respectively. These could represent intra mammary lymph nodes or
fibroadenomas.
No suspicious focal mass, signal or enhancement in the left
breast.
Slightly prominent right axillary lymph nodes with abnormal
morphology, largest measuring 9 mm (AP dimension, image 87 axial).

OPINION:
Right lateral breast vague large heterogeneous segmental non mass
enhancement. Ultrasound correlation is recommended with view of
biopsy.
Slightly prominent right axillary nodes. Although not significant
by size criteria, the morphology is concerning. Ultrasound
evaluation is recommended with view of ultrasound guided fine
needle aspiration biopsy.
Please submit requisition for this to our department and the
appointment will be facilitated.

x 1.4 TV cm. There is also extension of this medially at
approximately 5 O'clock position. The overall parenchymal
involvement spans from 7 to 12 O'clock position.
In image 79 and 80, there are two small oval shaped enhancing
masses with probably non enhancing septation measuring 5 and 7 mm
respectively. These could represent intra mammary lymph nodes or
fibroadenomas.
No suspicious focal mass, signal or enhancement in the left
breast.
Slightly prominent right axillary lymph nodes with abnormal
morphology, largest measuring 9 mm (AP dimension, image 87 axial).

OPINION:
Right lateral breast vague large heterogeneous segmental non mass
enhancement. Ultrasound correlation is recommended with view of
biopsy.
Slightly prominent right axillary nodes. Although not significant
by size criteria, the morphology is concerning. Ultrasound
evaluation is recommended with view of ultrasound guided fine
needle aspiration biopsy.
Please submit requisition for this to our department and the
appointment will be facilitated.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Incidental mass in right subareolar region
on MRI from St. Michael's hospital. No mammographic abnormality.
Post menopausal.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: There are no prior MRIs at this institution for
comparison.

FINDINGS:

There is scattered fibroglandular tissue showing a minimal degree
and intensity of enhancement.

There are scattered, small cysts in the left breast. There is no
mass or abnormal enhancement.

In the right breast there is a mass measuring 7 x 9 x 13 mm in the
central, lower, right breast which has spiculated, ill defined
borders. There is no associated T2 signal abnormality and it
shows rapid enhancement with plateau.

There are no other areas of abnormal enhancement or masses
identified.

There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

Indeterminate mass like enhancement in the right breast. Targeted
ultrasound +/- biopsy is suggested. If not seen on US then MR
guided biopsy is suggested.

FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Outside mammograms of February 2008 and a report
of the outside MRI done at Mount Sinai March 2008

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Very little
background of parenchymal enhancement.

In the left breast, in the lower outer quadrant, between 4 to 5
o'clock position is an area of linear/clumped segmental
enhancement (images 9-20). This occupies the middle and the
posterior third of the left breast. The area of enhancement
measures 3 X 5.4 X 2.6 cm (SI X AP X T). It shows a rapid initial
enhancement with plateau. It is mildly hyperintense on T2
weighted images. It corresponds to the area of linear
microcalcifications on the mammogram.

As described on the outside MRI, on the delayed axial images,
there is a foci of enhancement approximately 2.6 cm anterior to
the large area of segmental enhancement described above. This
area is located in the anterior third of the breast (image 16)
also in the lower outer quadrant approximately 2.5 cm below the
nipple. It is therefore located in the same quadrant. It
measures approximately 6 mm. this area of enhancement is the most
likely related to the same process as above and this should to be
included in the area of excision

In the right breast, in the lower outer quadrant (images 70-74),
there is a similar area of linear clumped enhancement measuring
8.5 x 12.2 x 12.7 mm (SI X AP X T). It has similar kinetics as on
the left side. Targeted ultrasound of the right breast suggested.
If not seen, MRI guided biopsy suggested. No mammographic
microcalcifications to correspond to this area of enhancement.

IMPRESSION:

Area of disease left breast are stated above for which excision of
the entire area of segmental enhancement including the other foci
anteriorly also suggested.

Indeterminate area of enhancement right breast posteriorly in the
lower outer quadrant for which targeted ultrasound suggested and
if not seen, MRI guided biopsy suggested.

Addendum # 1 by Carrie Betel on 2008-Apr-23 0805

ADDENDUM:

The patient's case was discussed at the breast group
multidisciplinary rounds. It was decided to further image the
left anterior focus seen on MRI (image 16). While a specific
focus of suspicious calcifications in this area is not seen,
further evaluation with dedicated magnification views and targeted
ultrasound are recommended.

A verbal report will be sent and an appointment facilitated.

ADDENDUM 2:

Actually the patient has had left anterior magnification view
covering this area. No suspicious focus of calcifications are
seen to correlate to the MRI focus. Targeted left ultrasound is
recommended. A verbal report will be sent and an appointment
facilitated.

CLINICAL HISTORY: High risk screening study. Routine screening of
the left breast and 6 month follow-up with attempted MR biopsy
right breast.

TECHNIQUE: Axial and coronal T 1 weighted localizer images were
obtained of both breasts. Sagittal T 2 FSE with fat saturation,
sagittal 3D T 1 SPGR images pre and post gadolinium
administration were obtained. Post imaging subtraction images were
produced.

REFERENCE EXAMS: Right breast MRI from 9/20/2002 and bilateral
breast MRI from 7/17/2002.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate to marked amount of fibroglandular tissue
throughout both breasts. Stable very minimally enhancing
circumscribed mass posteriorly right breast 12:00 measuring 1.0 cm
with nonenhancing internal septations and a bright T 2 signal in
keeping with a stable fibroadenoma. The previously identified foci
of enhancement are no longer evident and were likely related to
previous benign spontaneous hormonally induced enhancement.

No significant enhancement in the left breast.

IMPRESSION:

No evidence of malignancy.

Stable right breast fibroadenoma.

88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 6
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium (Omniscan, gadodiamide) contrast was
administered at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec scan delay. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4,
TR: 8.3) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.
Kinetic curve analysis was performed.

REFERENCE EXAM: February 8, 2007.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. Scattered subcentimeter cysts in both breasts.
Background parenchymal enhancement, remaining moderate in degree,
both stippled and heterogeneus, multi regional in distribution and
appearance and moderate intensity, increased from the previous
study.

In the posterior upper inner quadrant left breast (image 20-22)
there is a new lobulated mass with irregular margins and
heterogeneous internal enhancement, type 3 curve, moderate to
marked intensity enhancement. This is located at approximately 10
to 11 o'clock. Just medially, approximately 12 o'clock, posterior
1/3 (image 17) is a 3 mm enhancing focus and just inferiorly at
the junction of the posterior and middle 1/3 is a new 6 mm
heterogeneously focal enhancing area with moderate initial and
plateau delayed enhancement (also image 17).

Stable benign appearing mass upper outer quadrant left breast
(image 5) measuring 6 mm, approximately 1 to 2 o'clock, unchanged
in keeping with an intramammary lymph node or fibroadenoma.

No concerning abnormality right breast.

On the axial images of the chest, limited in assessment there is a
7 mm nonspecific nodule, possible lymph node in the left
infraclavicular region (series 9, image 129). This was not
definitely visualized previously. No concerning axillary lymph
nodes.

OPINION: Suspicious new left breast mass upper inner quadrant.
Recommend ultrasound and additional mammographic views with view
to core biopsy. If not visible recommend MRI guided biopsy.

At the time of ultrasound evaluation, evaluation of the left
infraclavicular region also recommended to assess for possible
prominent lymph node in addition to axilla assessment.

Increased background parenchymal enhancement. 2 additional
non-mass enhancing lesions 12 o'clock left breast. These are
possibly physiologic. At the time of ultrasound evaluation
recommend attention to these areas. Also recommend
high-resolution left breast MRI timed to week 2 of the menstrual
cycle.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: High risk screening study. LMP February 11,
2008 (week 3 of menstrual cycle).

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 6
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium (Omniscan, gadodiamide) contrast was
administered at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec scan delay. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4,
TR: 8.3) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.
Kinetic curve analysis was performed.

REFERENCE EXAM: February 8, 2007.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. Scattered subcentimeter cysts in both breasts.
Background parenchymal enhancement, remaining moderate in degree,
both stippled and heterogeneus, multi regional in distribution and
appearance and moderate intensity, increased from the previous
study.

In the posterior upper inner quadrant left breast (image 20-22)
there is a new lobulated mass with irregular margins and
heterogeneous internal enhancement, type 3 curve, moderate to
marked intensity enhancement. This is located at approximately 10
to 11 o'clock. Just medially, approximately 12 o'clock, posterior
1/3 (image 17) is a 3 mm enhancing focus and just inferiorly at
the junction of the posterior and middle 1/3 is a new 6 mm
heterogeneously focal enhancing area with moderate initial and
plateau delayed enhancement (also image 17).

Stable benign appearing mass upper outer quadrant left breast
(image 5) measuring 6 mm, approximately 1 to 2 o'clock, unchanged
in keeping with an intramammary lymph node or fibroadenoma.

No concerning abnormality right breast.

On the axial images of the chest, limited in assessment there is a
7 mm nonspecific nodule, possible lymph node in the left
infraclavicular region (series 9, image 129). This was not
definitely visualized previously. No concerning axillary lymph
nodes.

OPINION: Suspicious new left breast mass upper inner quadrant.
Recommend ultrasound and additional mammographic views with view
to core biopsy. If not visible recommend MRI guided biopsy.

At the time of ultrasound evaluation, evaluation of the left
infraclavicular region also recommended to assess for possible
prominent lymph node in addition to axilla assessment.

Increased background parenchymal enhancement. 2 additional
non-mass enhancing lesions 12 o'clock left breast. These are
possibly physiologic. At the time of ultrasound evaluation
recommend attention to these areas. Also recommend
high-resolution left breast MRI timed to week 2 of the menstrual
cycle.

CLINICAL INDICATION: 41 years old, family history of breast
cancer. High risk screening MRI. Life time risk is 26%. LMP
April/01/2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained. Kinetic curve analysis was performed.

REFERENCE EXAM: No prior MRI available for comparison. Mammogram
from Oct/2008.

FINDINGS: There is marked amount of fibroglandular tissue
bilaterally with marked degree and intensity of background
parenchymal enhancement, this may limit the MRI sensitivity.

In the right breast, 9 o'clock axis laterally, middle 1/3 (image
79), there is a circumscribed round mass measuring 8 x 6 mm, 4 cm
from the nipple demonstrating rapid initial and delayed washout.
There is questionable extension of the mass medially measuring 11
mm (image 78) demonstrating heterogeneous enhancement, rapid
initial and plateau delayed enhancement.

No suspicious abnormality in the left breast.

No abnormal axillary lymph nodes.

OPINION: Indeterminant right breast mass warrants biopsy.
Ultrasound evaluation with view to biopsy recommended. If not
sonographically visible, MRI-guided biopsy recommended. A verbal
report will be called to the referring clinician's office and an
equipment will be facilitated upon receipt of the appropriate
requisition.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 62 yo with history of right breast
suspicious mass since o8/08.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Prior mammogram and ultrasound of Oct/10/2008.

FINDINGS:
Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. No
significant background parenchymal enhancement.
Corresponding to the mammographic and sonographic findings, there
is a sizeable right breast irregular mass in the upper outer
quadrant at 10 O'clock position (images 71-76).The mass has
spiculated margins and measures 2.6 AP x 2.7 CC x 2.1 TV cm and is
5.4 cm from the nipple. No extension is seen to the nipple or
chest wall and no definite T2 WI signal. The mass demonstrates
rapid initial and plateau delayed type of enhancement.
No MRI correlate for the previously described other mass located
laterally and superiorly to this mass.
No other suspicious focal mass or abnormal enhancement seen in
either breasts.
An incidental note is made of a small enhancing focus in the mid
sternum which appears hypointense on the non fat suppressed T1 WI.
Unfortunately, the sternum is not in the area of coverage in our
T2 WI sequences. This is of uncertain nature, however, metastatic
deposit to the sternum is highly suspicious.
Small (5 mm in short axis) right low axillary lymph node noted. No
other lymph nodes noted.
IMPRESSION:
Right breast upper outer quadrant suspicious mass, as described,
corresponding to the mammographic and sonographic finding. An US
guided biopsy has been recommended previously as well as fine
needle aspiration of the right low axillary lymph node. The
appointment will be facilitated.
Incidental finding of enhancing focus in the sternum, as
described. Given the signal characteristics, a metastatic deposit
cannot be totally excluded. Further evaluation with an MRI of the
sternum is highly recommended. We will leave this to be arranged
by your office.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Known fibrocystic breasts. Right breast
enlarging subareolar cyst with mural nodules,? Nodules due to
inspissated debris versus papillary solid nodules. Recommended for
MRI assessment. Reduction mammoplasty 2004.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Multiple prior mammograms and ultrasounds, most
recent August, 2009.

FINDINGS: The breasts are composed of mostly fibroglandular
tissue. There is a marked degree of moderate to marked intensity
bilateral diffuse heterogeneous and stippled parenchymal
enhancement, symmetrically throughout both breasts. Innumerable
cysts throughout both breasts. Ranging in size from subcentimeter
to 7.5 cm. Content of the cysts varies, including simple
appearing bright T2 fluid, some containing fluid debris levels and
some bright T1 content in keeping with proteinaceous content.

The largest cyst corresponding to the abnormality in question,
subareolar and medial right breast measures 7.4 x 4.1 x 6.5 cm (SI
x transverse x AP). This is a complex cystic mass with multiple
internal enhancing septations and multiple enhancing papillary
mural nodules. Mural nodules measure up to 1.1 cm, similar to the
ultrasound appearance. Nodules demonstrate a marked degree rapid
initial and some with delayed washout enhancement.

No additional focal concerning abnormality in either breast.

No concerning axillary lymph nodes.

OPINION: Complex cystic right breast mass contains enhancing mural
nodules and septations, therefore not debris within a complicated
cyst. This raises the concern for a cystic papillary carcinoma
and as recommended previously surgical consultation and surgical
excision are recommended.

Given the background dramatic parenchymal enhancement in the
context of marked fibrocystic breasts, limiting MRI sensitivity, a
6 month follow MRI recommended timed to week 2 of the menstrual
cycle is recommended.

INDICATION: New focal asymmetry in upper outer right breast on
mammogram (July, 2010), not seen on ultrasound. Stereotactic
biopsy demonstrated benign breast tissue. This MRI study is for
further assessment.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS:

There is a mild amount of breast tissue. There is a moderate
amount of mildly enhancing breast tissue.

In the right upper outer posterior breast, 9 .8 cm from the
nipple, there is a 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm spiculated mass (image 74),
which is slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging with central
hypointensity. This mass demonstrates a moderate progressive
degree of enhancement.

In the lower outer anterior right breast, there is heterogeneous
linear enhancement measuring 2.0 cm (image 77).

No suspicious findings in the left breast. No suspicious
lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Spiculated right breast mass is suspicious. This may
represent malignancy with entrapped fat, versus a small
infiltrated lymph node vs radial scar. An MRI-guided biopsy is
warranted. BI-RADS: 5.

2. Linear heterogeneous enhancement in the right breast is
suspicious, and should be further evaluated with targeted breast
ultrasound. If this area is not identified on ultrasound,
MRI-guided biopsy is suggested. BI-RADS: 4.

If the patient is not contacted by our department in two-three
weeks, she should call our Department to arrange this appointment.

nipple, there is a 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm spiculated mass (image 74),
which is slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging with central
hypointensity. This mass demonstrates a moderate progressive
degree of enhancement.

In the lower outer anterior right breast, there is heterogeneous
linear enhancement measuring 2.0 cm (image 77).

No suspicious findings in the left breast. No suspicious
lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Spiculated right breast mass is suspicious. This may
represent malignancy with entrapped fat, versus a small
infiltrated lymph node vs radial scar. An MRI-guided biopsy is
warranted. BI-RADS: 5.

2. Linear heterogeneous enhancement in the right breast is
suspicious, and should be further evaluated with targeted breast
ultrasound. If this area is not identified on ultrasound,
MRI-guided biopsy is suggested. BI-RADS: 4.

If the patient is not contacted by our department in two-three
weeks, she should call our Department to arrange this appointment.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Recurrent mastitis right breast.
Intraductal echogenic filling defect on the right noted on recent
ultrasound, scheduled for excision. Exclusion of additional
pathology.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate amount of breast parenchyma with mild
background stippled enhancement.

Within the central medial aspect of the right breast, there is a
small high T2 lobulated benign-appearing lesion measuring at 7 x 5
x 5 mm; most likely a small fibroadenoma. There is mild
tram-track enhancement superiorly at the midline, otherwise, no
corresponding lesion is noted at the expected region of the
echogenic ultrasound lesion. No other abnormalities are noted on
the right.

The left breast demonstrates a small focus (2.1 x 3.0 cm) of
asymmetric enhancement the upper outer quadrant. In addition,
there is a mild degree of distortion associated with this region
of asymmetry. This focus demonstrates a persistent enhancement
pattern.

OPINION:

No MR correlate to the intraductal lesion on the right is noted.
The remainder of the right breast is unremarkable.

Asymmetric focus of enhancement associated with mild distortio,
possible asymmetric normal parenchyma, however, further evaluation
with a second look ultrasound is warranted. If this region is not
visualized under ultrasound, an MR guided core biopsy is advised
due to possible distortion. This will be facilitated by our
department.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Further assessment of pathologically proven
right breast radial scar. LMP: September 25, 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.6, TR:7.3) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (5.6 cc)was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant with GD Swap
(TE:4, TR: 8.2) was then obtained. Post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison made to previous imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of breast tissue with a
moderate degree and intensity of enhancement. This limits MR
sensitivity. Bilateral small cysts.

Radial scar not seen on MRI. Right upper outer posterior oval
well defined mass with T2 bright signal. This shows enhancement
that washes out. The mass has a reniform shape with suggestion of
a fatty hilum and lies adjacent to a vessel. This lies 10.3 cm
from the nipple and measures 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm (image 63).

No other abnormal mass or enhancement. No other abnormal
lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: MR sensitivity is limited by background parenchymal
enhancement.

1. Radial scar not identified on MRI. Recommend surgical
consultation for excision.

2. Right upper outer posterior mass. This is suspected to be the
axillary lymph node previously biopsied (benign) but second look
ultrasound for confirmation is recommended. If not confirmed by
ultrasound, 6 month MRI follow up is recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Follow-up Rt non-mass enhancement. Post left
surgical biopsy for papillomas. Post hysterectomy

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.5, TR:7.1) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast ( 7.8 cc) was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec. Axial Vibrant with GD Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.2)
was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction
and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: MRI of 9/8/08 \T\ mammogram of Mar 27/09

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue. There are
post operative changes in the left subareolar region superiorly.
3 stable intramammary nodes are noted in the left lower outer
quadrant. These are high T2 and enhance. No high T1 precontrast
ducts are evident. No abnormal enhancement is seen in the left
breast.

On the right, non- mass enhancement is again seen in the RLOQ on
images 85 and 86 which is slightly less prominent than previously.
Another stable focal area of non-mass enhancement is seen in the
right lower outer quadrant posteriorly image 82. A 7 mm nodule
showing rapid early and delayed plateau enhancement on image 81
likely corresponds to a stable nodule seen in the nipple line of
the mammogram. No suspicious finding is seen.
IMPRESSION: Non-mass enhancement previously identified in the
right lower outer quadrant is stable. Other areas of enhancement
are also identified. Reassessment suggested in 1 year

processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D
reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Ultrasound 3/25/2008, mammogram 3/4/2008

FINDINGS:

Minimal volume background breast parenchyma, mild amount and
intensity background enhancement.

In the right upper outer quadrant, probably corresponding to the
area biopsied adjacent to the scar, there is a small area of
clumped non mass enhancement, together measuring 1.3cm AP x 0.3cm
height x 0.3cm in width (image 73, 74). There is a round,
hypervascular and hyperintense T2 mass, 0.5cm diameter in the
upper outer quadrant, almost certainly an intramammary node, image
76, however cannot definitively identify fat within its hilum to
confirm. Suggest second look ultrasound for correlation +/-FNA as
needed at the time of ultrasound. No other suspicious enhancement
in either breast.

There is a 6mm round lesion within the manubrium that is
hypervascular and hypointense on precontrast T1 weighted images.
Due to its midline position was not imaged with T2 sequence.


IMPRESSION:

Small area of clumped non mass enhancement corresponds to the
sonographic finding. BIRADS 6.

Probable intramammary node upper outer quadrant, round with lack
of a fatty hilum, for ultrasound correlatio +/- FNA.

Nonspecific 6mm hypervascular bone lesion within manubrium. This
may be incidental, especially if there is no underlying invasive
disease. Due to its small size, bone scan may not be helpful.
Consider short term follow up with MRI in 3 months.

dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Consult report of 06/01/09.

FINDINGS:

There is a large amount of breast tissue showing a mild degree and
moderate intensity of enhancement which limits sensitivity.

In the right breast, subareolar region, there is a well
circumscribed, macrolobulated enhancing mass which measures 0.9 x
0.4 x 0.3 cm (image 64). It has smooth margins and demonstrates
rapid and persistent enhancement. There is a second mass, image
60, which is round, well circumscribed and also shows rapid and
persistent enhancement. This second mass measures 0.4 cm and has
high T2 signal.

In the left breast there is a small, 5 mm, heterogeneously
enhancing mass (image 3) in the LOQ posteriorly with high T2 which
shows rapid early enhancement with washout. It is possibly a
node.

There are no suspicious axillary lymph nodes.

OPINION: Bilateral non-specific enhancing masses. On the left
this could be a lymph node. On the right these could be
fibroadenomata. However in this clincal setting bilateral US is
suggested. If the mass on the left is identified as a normal
node, follow-up would be suggested. If the masses on the right are
identified and appear benign, follow-up is suggested. If no
correlates on US then an MRI guided biopsy is suggested of the
medial posterior lesion on the right. This will be facilitated by
our department. Please submit the appropriate requisition.

more in the left breast than the right. There is a circumscribed
round 13 cm diameter mass occupying most of the right breast which
has high T2 and high T1 precontrast contents. This suggests fluid
and proeinaceous or bloody contents. Most of the wall is thin and
smooth but there is an irregular enhancing component on its medial
aspect which is possibly granulation tissue although a papillary
lesion cannot be completely excluded. There are abnormal right
axillary nodes with thickened cortex.

On the left image 10 in the lower outer quadrant there is an 11 mm
heterogeneously enhancing circumscribed oval mass with
non-enhancing internal septations with rapid early and persistent
delayed enhancement. No suspicious finding is seen in the left
breast.
IMPRESSION: Large mass in the right breast is probably benign in
appearance. There is an enhancing component which is likely
granulation tissue rather than a papillary lesion lesion.
Surgical intervention is likely required.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Post partum mass right breast. Treated with
antibiotics. Aspirate showed blood with pus cells. LMP Sept 2008

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.5, TR:7.1) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (6 cc) was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant with GD Swap
(TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 49 years-old female. High breast density.
Probable left breast carcinoma detected on recent imaging.

L.M.P.: August 16, 2009

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Baseline MRI.

FINDINGS:
There is a marked amount of fibroglandular breast tissue.
Marked degree of moderate to marked intensity background stippled
and heterogeneous parenchymal enhancement.

Multiple bilateral cysts. A few of them demonstrate thin rim
enhancement, consistent with inflamed cysts.

The sonographic suspicious left breast mass corresponds to a
rapidly enhancing irregular mass with areas of wash-out with
irregular margins, isointense in T2 and measuring 2.2 x 1.3 x 1.8
cm (image 19). Three tiny (2 mm) enhancing satellite nodules are
seen in close proximity to the dominant mass and the total area
measures approximately 2.2 x 2.6 x 2.1 cm. No evidence of nipple
or chest-wall enhancement.

No area of suspicious enhancement in the right breast.

Four left and one right internal mammary lymph nodes are
identified. These are all very small and with a normal appearing
fatty hilum, of doubtful significance. No concerning axillary
lymphadenopathy.

6 mm nonspecific hypodense lesion in the right central liver.


OPINION: Enhancing mass in the central left breast with satellite
nodules, highly suspicious for breast carcinoma. Ultrasound guided
core biopsy was previously recommended.

Nonspecific liver nodule. Ultrasound evaluation recommended.

were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a small amount of breast tissue with a
moderate degree and intensity of stippled background parenchymal
enhancement. This limits the MRI sensitivity.

Left lower outer quadrant enhancing mass (image 19), 1.5 cm AP x
0.8 cm CC x 0.9 cm TV, 6.7 cm from the nipple, with no
corresponding T2 signal. This appears to correlate to the
mammographic/sonographic finding.

Right 6 o'clock slightly irregular enhancing mass (image 79), 0.7
cm AP x 0.4 cm CC x 0.3 cm TV cm, 0.5 cm from the nipple, with
mild bright corresponding T2 signal. This could be parenchymal or
could be a correlate to the sonographic finding.

No other abnormal mass or enhancement in either breast.

No abnormal lymph nodes.

OPINION: MRI sensitivity limited by background parenchymal
enhancement. Bilateral MRI masses likely correspond to the
bilateral sonographic masses. Again, ultrasound guided biopsy of
both is recommended. Please submit a requisition for this to our
department.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Palpable mass in the right breast. LMP
April 13th.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: There are no prior MRIs for comparison.

FINDINGS:

There is a large amount of breast tissue showing a marked degree
and intensity of stippled and nodular enhancement.

In the right breast there are multiple masses in the upper outer
and upper inner quadrants which demonstrate marked, rapid, early
enhancement with washout. The largest is at the 12 o'clock
position (image 64) and measures 2.0 X 2.5 x 2.0 cm (SI x
transverse x AP). This mass is round, spiculated, with marked,
rapid enhancement and washout. On image 58, there is a 6 mm mass
in the middle third, at the 3 o'clock position which has rapid
enhancement and washout. There is non-mass like enhancement in
the inferior breast predominantly involving the outer quadrant.

The left breast has a background of stippled and nodular
enhancement which limits sensitivity. There is a 7 mm, irregular,
ill defined mass which is larger than the others and shows
progressive enhancement (image 19) in the upper inner quadrant.
The remainder of the masses are of similar size and character.

There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

1. The findings are in keeping with a multifocal, multicentric
cancer with the largest mass at the 12 o'clock position of the
right breast. As on the recent mammogram, this should be
evaluated with targeted ultrasound and biopsied under ultrasound
guidance.

2. The non-mass enhancement in the right lower, outer quadrant
should also be evaluated with targeted ultrasound +/- biopsy.

3. If there is no sonographic correlate for the non mass
enhancement in the right lower outer quadrant then the 6 mm mass
(image 58) at the 3 o'clock position should be evaluated with
targeted ultrasound +/- biopsy.

4. If the mass at 3 o'clock in the right breast is not seen then
targeted ultrasound and biopsy should be carried out on the mass
that is furthest from the primary.

5. Targeted ultrasound evaluation fo the largest mass in the left
breast (image 19) is also suggested +/- biopsy. If this is not
seen at ultrasound then MR guided biopsy is suggested.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Palpable right breast mass and axillary adenopathy.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral mammogram from same day was reviewed.
Images from outside ultrasound performed 7/26/2010 and outside
mammogram dated 8/23/10 were also reviewed.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount breast tissue with mild
degree/intensity enhancement.

No abnormal mass or enhancement in the left breast.

Right breast contains diffuse non mass enhancement centered in the
upper outer quadrant but involving all 4 quadrants and extending
into the nipple, which is retracted. There is no chest wall
involvement. This is difficult to measure but is roughly 11.6 CC
x 12.0 AP x 8.9 TV cm. There is associated skin thickening.

Multiple abnormal enlarged right axillary level 1 lymph nodes,
marker measures 2.7 cm in short axis diameter.

Multiple left axillary lymph nodes with normal reniform shape and
fatty hila but slightly thick cortex, marker 9 mm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Abnormal right breast enhancement involving all 4 quadrants
and nipple, suspicious for multicentric right breast cancer,
possibly lobular. Enlarged right axillary lymph nodes. Recommend
whole right breast and axilla ultrasound, with ultrasound guided
biopsy of the breast in 2 quadrants and axillary lymph node.

2. Left axillary nodes are prominent but could be within normal
limits. Recommend ultrasound evaluation.

3. Bilateral mammogram was performed today, please refer to that
report for mammographic findings.

Please submit requisitions for this to our department. If there

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 68 year old with node positive breast cancer
without obvious breast primary lesion. Has had prior left
axillary lymph node dissection after presenting post fall with a
left axillary mass.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison is made to a mammogram of the same
date. Please refer to that report for more details.

FINDINGS: The breasts are predominantly fatty. There is no
significant background enhancement.

There is a small amount of non-mass like enhancement with a fine
clumped linear appearance in the anterior 1/3 of the upper left
breast (image 17). There is some mild skin thickening and
enhancement overlying this area. The area of enhancement extends
toward the nipple and correlates with the asymmetric nodularity
seen on the mammogram of the same date.

No abnormality is identified in the right breast.

There are post surgical changes in the left axilla. There are no
abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

The small area of non-mass enhancement in the upper outer quadrant
of the left breast correlates with the asymmetric nodularity on
mammogram. The patient is being recalled for additional views and
ultrasound +/- biopsy. If there is no ultrasound correlate or
biopsy cannot be performed with US or mammography, then an MR
guided biopsy is suggested.

CLINICAL INDICATION: 48 years old, previous biopsy showed ADH in
left breast 3 O'clock in one out of five cores, to evaluate extent
of disease. LMP Feb/2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No prior MRI available for comparison.

FINDINGS:
There is moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue. There is mild
degree of moderate intensity of stippled background parenchymal
enhancement.
The postbiopsy clip is identified at 3 O'clock position. There is
no suspicious enhancement or signal surrounding the clip to
correspond to the mammographic residual calcifications.
Approximately 18 mm inferior and lateral to the clip, there is a
small slightly spiculated mass (image 14) which measures 5 AP x 5
CC x 5 TV mm demonstrating very rapid initial and platuea delayed
enhancement (Type II curve) with no associated T2 signal.
Approximately 2 cm anterior to this, there is a similar but
smaller slightly spiculated mass (image 17), measuring 4 AP x 3 CC
x 4 TV mm with mild associated bright T2 signal. This demonstrate
mild rapid initial and plateau type of enhancement.

No suspicious signal or enhancement in either breast.
Bilateral breast cyst, the largest in the right breast measuring
1.8 cm in CC dimension.
No significant adenopathy.

OPINION:
No suspicious MRI signal or enhancement in the area surrounding
the clip.
Two slightly spiculated left breast masses, as described. Further
evaluation with a second look ultrasound is recommended. If
sonographically occult, MRI guided biopsy is recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: High Risk screening. Baseline MRI.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:8.1) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.6, TR:7.3) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus
injection. Axial Vibrant Gd delayed with FS (TE 2.8, TR 5.7) and
axial Vibrant with GD Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.2) were then obtained.
Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D
reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Prior mammograms.

FINDINGS:

LMP: August 08, 2008

Heterogeneously dense breasts bilaterally with moderate degree and
intensity of background enhancement.
Bilateral few tiny cysts, some complicated.
No concerning enhancement noted on the left side.
On the right side there is evidence of a linear moderately
persistent enhancement in the lower outer quadrant, posterior
third for a length of 1.1 cm.
IMPRESSION: Linear enhancement in right lower outer quadrant
posterior third. This lesion is unlikely to be seen on
ultrasound. Considering the personal history, MRI guided biopsy
is suggested.
We will facilitate the appointment.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Right blood nipple discharge with resultant resection
of a right nipple adenoma with atypical ductal hyperplasia
incompletely excised. Rule out residual disease. History of
previous right benign surgical biopsy and bilateral
sonographically seen breast masses. LMP March 9 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to previous imaging.

FINDINGS: Large amount of breast tissue in both breasts with
moderate degree and intensity of background enhancement. This,
along with the bilateral breast masses and cysts, reduces the
sensitivity of MRI.

Right post operative change. Linear non mass enhancement directly
deep to the nipple, 2.0 cm long with no T2 bright signal (image
67). Posterior 12 o'clock non mass enhancement increasing with
time and with no T2 bright signal, 1.2 x 1.1 cm (image 65);
possibly parenchyma.

Bilateral breast masses are seen, all with mild heterogeneous
enhancing which increased over time. Some have mild associated T2
bright signal while others do not. These likely correspond to the
sonographically seen masses although direct comparison is
difficult due to altered positioning of the breast. Ultimately,
the masses are better seen and followed by ultrasound.

Right masses:
- 10 o'clock 3 cm from nipple - 14 x 12 mm (image 63), no T2
signal
- 9 o'clock 5 cm from nipple - 6 x 5 mm (image 63), mild T2 signal
- 11 o'clock 5 cm from nipple - 8 x 9 mm (image 62), no T2 signal
- 1 o'clock 4 cm from nipple - 22 x 14 mm (image 70), mild T2
signal

Left masses:
- 8 o'clock 2 cm from nipple - 13 x 12 mm (image 11), mild T2
signal
- 11 o'clock 4 cm from nipple - 9 x 7 mm (image 20), no T2 signal
- 3 o'clock 3 cm from nipple - 15 x 8 mm (image 8), no T2 signal

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.

OPINION: Background enhancement limits MRI sensitivity.

1. Right subareolar non mass linear enhancement, indeterminate.
Recommend targeted right breast ultrasound (and biopsy); if not
seen by ultrasound, recommend MRI guided biopsy. Please submit a
requisition for this to our department.

2. Right superior posterior non mass enhancement, possibly
parenchymal. Recommend targeted right breast ultrasound; if not
seen by ultrasound, recommend 6 month MRI follow up.

3. Bilateral breast masses. These are better seen and followed
by ultrasound. Recommend follow up as per the previous ultrasound
report (targeted bilateral ultrasound of some masses in 6 months).

4. Next bilateral mammogram is due in December 2009.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION:  31 yo female. Bilateral stable masses.  Papilloma with atypia in the right breast excised in 2009. Treated for adenoma and ADH in 2000.

Recent mammogram showed new clusters of microcalcifications in the upper outer to midportion of the right breast.  Ill-defined hypoechoic area seen in the 12:00 position of the right breast on ultrasound.  Needs MRI correlation.

LMP: April 8, 2011

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1
weighted 3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3mm slices, under
90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  multiple prior breast imaging studies including most recent MRI from 5/15/2010

FINDINGS:

 Large amount of breast tissue with marked degree and intensity of diffuse heterogenous enhancement; this limits MRI sensitivity.  Overall background enhancement has increased from previous.  Multiple scattered bilateral small cysts.

Bilateral masses are again seen in both breasts.  They demonstrate mild heterogeneous enhancement with increasing enhancement over time. Some of these masses demonstrate increased T2 signal.  They have been stable on MRI since 2009 and likely benign:

Left breast:
1. Image 11, 3 o'clock position, middle third - 12 mm, stable
2. Image 12, 3 o'clock position, middle third - 15 mm, stable
3. Image 22, 9 o'clock position, posterior third - 7 mm, stable

Right breast
1. Image 64, 3 o'clock position, posterior third, 6 mm, stable
2 Image 66, 2 o'clock position, middle third, 17 x 12 mm , stable.
3 Image 74, 11 o'clock position, posterior third, 23 mm, stable.

There are few new enhancing lesions in both breasts which are new or more prominent from previous. They demonstrate similar enhancement/morphology as the stable benign masses:

Left breast
1. Image 18, 6 o'clock position, posterior third, 10 x 10 mm, vaguely seen in 2009
2. Image 22, 7 o'clock position, posterior third, 9 x 10 mm, new

Right breast
1. Image 77, 9 o'clock position, anterior third, 8 mm, new from previous.
2. Image 78, 7 o'clock position, middle third, 12 x 8 mm, new from previous.

The right 12 o'clock posterior focal triangular-shaped non-mass enhancement is stable, 13 x 11 mm (image 69).

There is another ill-defined 1.3 cm non-mass enhancement just inferior triangular-shaped non-mass on image 70, which is also unchanged from previous.  We suspect this may correspond to the ill-defined hypoechoic region in the 12:00 right breast seen
on ultrasound.

No lymphadenopathy.


IMPRESSION:

1.   Marked background enhancement limits the current MRI assessment.  There are multiple masses in both breasts stable since 2009 and likely benign.  They do not require specific followup.

2.   There are several new enhancing lesions in both breasts which may be related to the increased background enhancement.  They share similar enhancement pattern and morphology as the benign masses.  They can be followed with MRI in 6 months.
Followup MRI should be timed to day 7 to 10 of the menstrual cycle to limit background enhancement.

3.   Ill-defined non-mass enhancement in the 12:00 right breast is stable (image 70).  However, it may correspond to the hypoechoic region at 12:00 seen on US and the area of microcalcifications on mammogram.  Stereotactic biopsy of the
microcalcifications and ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the 12:00 hypoechoic mass is recommended.

90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  multiple prior breast imaging studies including most recent MRI from 5/15/2010

FINDINGS:

 Large amount of breast tissue with marked degree and intensity of diffuse heterogenous enhancement; this limits MRI sensitivity.  Overall background enhancement has increased from previous.  Multiple scattered bilateral small cysts.

Bilateral masses are again seen in both breasts.  They demonstrate mild heterogeneous enhancement with increasing enhancement over time. Some of these masses demonstrate increased T2 signal.  They have been stable on MRI since 2009 and likely benign:

Left breast:
1. Image 11, 3 o'clock position, middle third - 12 mm, stable
2. Image 12, 3 o'clock position, middle third - 15 mm, stable
3. Image 22, 9 o'clock position, posterior third - 7 mm, stable

Right breast
1. Image 64, 3 o'clock position, posterior third, 6 mm, stable
2 Image 66, 2 o'clock position, middle third, 17 x 12 mm , stable.
3 Image 74, 11 o'clock position, posterior third, 23 mm, stable.

There are few new enhancing lesions in both breasts which are new or more prominent from previous. They demonstrate similar enhancement/morphology as the stable benign masses:

Left breast
1. Image 18, 6 o'clock position, posterior third, 10 x 10 mm, vaguely seen in 2009
2. Image 22, 7 o'clock position, posterior third, 9 x 10 mm, new

Right breast
1. Image 77, 9 o'clock position, anterior third, 8 mm, new from previous.
2. Image 78, 7 o'clock position, middle third, 12 x 8 mm, new from previous.

The right 12 o'clock posterior focal triangular-shaped non-mass enhancement is stable, 13 x 11 mm (image 69).

There is another ill-defined 1.3 cm non-mass enhancement just inferior triangular-shaped non-mass on image 70, which is also unchanged from previous.  We suspect this may correspond to the ill-defined hypoechoic region in the 12:00 right breast seen
on ultrasound.

No lymphadenopathy.


IMPRESSION:

1.   Marked background enhancement limits the current MRI assessment.  There are multiple masses in both breasts stable since 2009 and likely benign.  They do not require specific followup.

2.   There are several new enhancing lesions in both breasts which may be related to the increased background enhancement.  They share similar enhancement pattern and morphology as the benign masses.  They can be followed with MRI in 6 months.
Followup MRI should be timed to day 7 to 10 of the menstrual cycle to limit background enhancement.

3.   Ill-defined non-mass enhancement in the 12:00 right breast is stable (image 70).  However, it may correspond to the hypoechoic region at 12:00 seen on US and the area of microcalcifications on mammogram.  Stereotactic biopsy of the
microcalcifications and ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the 12:00 hypoechoic mass is recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Right blood nipple discharge with resultant resection
of a right nipple adenoma with atypical ductal hyperplasia
incompletely excised. Rule out residual disease. History of
previous right benign surgical biopsy and bilateral
sonographically seen breast masses. LMP March 9 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to previous imaging.

FINDINGS: Large amount of breast tissue in both breasts with
moderate degree and intensity of background enhancement. This,
along with the bilateral breast masses and cysts, reduces the
sensitivity of MRI.

Right post operative change. Linear non mass enhancement directly
deep to the nipple, 2.0 cm long with no T2 bright signal (image
67). Posterior 12 o'clock non mass enhancement increasing with
time and with no T2 bright signal, 1.2 x 1.1 cm (image 65);
possibly parenchyma.

Bilateral breast masses are seen, all with mild heterogeneous
enhancing which increased over time. Some have mild associated T2
bright signal while others do not. These likely correspond to the
sonographically seen masses although direct comparison is
difficult due to altered positioning of the breast. Ultimately,
the masses are better seen and followed by ultrasound.

Right masses:
- 10 o'clock 3 cm from nipple - 14 x 12 mm (image 63), no T2
signal
- 9 o'clock 5 cm from nipple - 6 x 5 mm (image 63), mild T2 signal
- 11 o'clock 5 cm from nipple - 8 x 9 mm (image 62), no T2 signal
- 1 o'clock 4 cm from nipple - 22 x 14 mm (image 70), mild T2
signal

Left masses:
- 8 o'clock 2 cm from nipple - 13 x 12 mm (image 11), mild T2
signal
- 11 o'clock 4 cm from nipple - 9 x 7 mm (image 20), no T2 signal
- 3 o'clock 3 cm from nipple - 15 x 8 mm (image 8), no T2 signal

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.

OPINION: Background enhancement limits MRI sensitivity.

1. Right subareolar non mass linear enhancement, indeterminate.
Recommend targeted right breast ultrasound (and biopsy); if not
seen by ultrasound, recommend MRI guided biopsy. Please submit a
requisition for this to our department.

2. Right superior posterior non mass enhancement, possibly
parenchymal. Recommend targeted right breast ultrasound; if not
seen by ultrasound, recommend 6 month MRI follow up.

3. Bilateral breast masses. These are better seen and followed
by ultrasound. Recommend follow up as per the previous ultrasound
report (targeted bilateral ultrasound of some masses in 6 months).

4. Next bilateral mammogram is due in December 2009.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Kmown malignancy RUOQ - for extent of disease \T\ nodal assessment Post menopausal

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted  3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:8.6) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:7.8) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast (5 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammograms of 2011

FINDINGS: The breasts have a large amount of fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement.  There are several small complicated cysts bilaterally.  No suspicious finding in the left breast.

On the right there is a large dominant heterogeneously rim enhancing mass in the upper posterior central breast slightly laterally measuring approximately 3.3 cm in diameter.  There are multiple, at least 7 satellite nodules which are both superior
and inferior to the dominant mass.  There is an 8 mm nodule in image 53 superior to the dominant mass.  There are multiple masses inferiorly and posteriorly.  The extent of disease is 8 cm in SI dimension 5.7 centimeters in the AP and 3 cm in the
transverse.  Extending between the more posterior and anterior masses inferiorly there is a linear non-mass enhancement.  No involvement of the pectoralis muscle or skin is seen.  There is a large abnormal right internal mammary node with a large
abnormal interpectoral node and abnormal axillary nodes.  Incidentally noted on the axial projection are multiple hypointense masses in the liver measuring up to 6.5 cm in diameter, possibly cystic.

OPINION: Known malignancy in the right breast has multiple satellite masses together measuring up to 8 cm in extent with metastatic disease to axillary, internal mammary and interpectoral nodes.  Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of the dominant
mass for receptors as well as fine needle aspiration of an abnormal lymph node have been requested.

Further evaluation of the lesions in the liver with ultrasound is suggested.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Biopsy proven left breast invasive cancer
with focal in situ component (prior work-up done at an outside
institution). Pre-operative MRI to determine extent of disease.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76.1, TR:2500) fat saturated images, Sagittal VIBRANT without Fat
Saturation (TE: 4.2, TR: 7.2), pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3
mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of IV
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial
VIBRANT with gad and axial VIBRANT with Gad Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction
and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No prior imaging available at this institution.

FINDINGS:

BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM:

The breasts are extremely dense. This can obscure mammographic
masses. A BB marks the site of the palpable finding left breast
(biopsy proven cancer). Corresponding to the palpable
abnormality, in the central left breast, best seen on the MLO and
compression magnification ML views, there is an obscured mass with
spiculated margins causing surrounding architectural distortion
with approximate dimensions of 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm. No obvious
associated calcifications.

There are punctate calcifications in the upper outer left breast
(approximately 3 o'clock, 10 cm from the nipple) which are favored
benign.

No concerning abnormality noted in the right breast.

BILATERAL MRI:

The patient is week 3 of the menstrual cycle.

There is a large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally with
mild degree of moderate intensity enhancement.

Corresponding to the known malignancy (image 10), there is a 3.9 x
2.9 x 1.9 cm irregular mass with spiculated margins and
heterogeneous internal enhancement in the inferior lateral left
breast, middle to posterior thirds with extension into the
anterior breast. The mass extends medially to the nipple line.
There is no corresponding high T2 signal and it exhibits rapid
initial with plateau delayed enhancement. There are several
satellite nodules surrounding this dominant mass with similar MRI
characteristics. Overall dimensions of tumor involvement
including satellite lesions is 3.9 (SI) x 4.7 (AP) x 1.9 cm.
Adjacent to the dominant mass in the central breast (image 16),
there is segmental clumped non-mass enhancement measuring 2.8 cm also suspicious for disease.

In the superior medial left breast (image 20), there are two
discrete masses each measuring 0.7 cm which are concerning for
satellite lesions. There is no obvious invasion of the pectoralis
muscle or chest wall.

There is focal non-mass enhancement in the medial right breast
measuring 1.2 x 0.8 cm. This is favored parenchymal. There is no
other suspicious signal or enhancement within the right breast.

There is a prominent left axillary lymph node measuring
approximately 0.7 cm. Although, this is not enlarged by size
criteria it appears larger when compared with the other nodes.
There are small bilateral internal mammary lymph nodes of
questionable clinical significance.

IMPRESSION:

1. Locally advanced left breast cancer with an overall
infiltrating nodular pattern (type 2). Suspicion for multifocal
involvement in the superior medial left breast. Recommend
second-look targeted ultrasound. If clinically appropriate biopsy
of any additional findings can be arranged. BI-RADS: 6

2. Prominent left axillary lymph node. Recommend ultrasound left
axilla with view to FNA. BI-RADS: 4

3. Small bilateral internal mammary lymph nodes of questionable
significance. These can be reassessed at the time of follow-up
MRIs.

4. Focal areas of non-mass enhancement in the medial right breast
are favored parenchymal. The medial right breast can be evaluated
at the time of the second look targeted ultrasound. If there is
no sonographic correlate, then follow-up at post neoadjuvant
treatment MRI recommended. BI-RADS: 3

A verbal report will be given and an appointment for the
additional imaging facilitated.

BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM:

The breasts are extremely dense. This can obscure mammographic
masses. A BB marks the site of the palpable finding left breast
(biopsy proven cancer). Corresponding to the palpable
abnormality, in the central left breast, best seen on the MLO and
compression magnification ML views, there is an obscured mass with
spiculated margins causing surrounding architectural distortion
with approximate dimensions of 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm. No obvious
associated calcifications.

There are punctate calcifications in the upper outer left breast
(approximately 3 o'clock, 10 cm from the nipple) which are favored
benign.

No concerning abnormality noted in the right breast.

BILATERAL MRI:

The patient is week 3 of the menstrual cycle.

There is a large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally with
mild degree of moderate intensity enhancement.

Corresponding to the known malignancy (image 10), there is a 3.9 x
2.9 x 1.9 cm irregular mass with spiculated margins and
heterogeneous internal enhancement in the inferior lateral left
breast, middle to posterior thirds with extension into the
anterior breast. The mass extends medially to the nipple line.
There is no corresponding high T2 signal and it exhibits rapid
initial with plateau delayed enhancement. There are several
satellite nodules surrounding this dominant mass with similar MRI
characteristics. Overall dimensions of tumor involvement
including satellite lesions is 3.9 (SI) x 4.7 (AP) x 1.9 cm.
Adjacent to the dominant mass in the central breast (image 16),
there is segmental clumped non-mass enhancement measuring 2.8 cm also suspicious for disease.

In the superior medial left breast (image 20), there are two
discrete masses each measuring 0.7 cm which are concerning for
satellite lesions. There is no obvious invasion of the pectoralis
muscle or chest wall.

There is focal non-mass enhancement in the medial right breast
measuring 1.2 x 0.8 cm. This is favored parenchymal. There is no
other suspicious signal or enhancement within the right breast.

There is a prominent left axillary lymph node measuring
approximately 0.7 cm. Although, this is not enlarged by size
criteria it appears larger when compared with the other nodes.
There are small bilateral internal mammary lymph nodes of
questionable clinical significance.

IMPRESSION:

1. Locally advanced left breast cancer with an overall
infiltrating nodular pattern (type 2). Suspicion for multifocal
involvement in the superior medial left breast. Recommend
second-look targeted ultrasound. If clinically appropriate biopsy
of any additional findings can be arranged. BI-RADS: 6

2. Prominent left axillary lymph node. Recommend ultrasound left
axilla with view to FNA. BI-RADS: 4

3. Small bilateral internal mammary lymph nodes of questionable
significance. These can be reassessed at the time of follow-up
MRIs.

4. Focal areas of non-mass enhancement in the medial right breast
are favored parenchymal. The medial right breast can be evaluated
at the time of the second look targeted ultrasound. If there is
no sonographic correlate, then follow-up at post neoadjuvant
treatment MRI recommended. BI-RADS: 3

A verbal report will be given and an appointment for the
additional imaging facilitated.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

FINDINGS:

There is large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally.
Moderate degree and intensity of background of parenchymal
enhancement. Small cyst are seen in bilaterally.

In the left breast at 12 o'clock is an irregular mass measuring
approximately 16 x 16 mm (image 67). This is located at 12
o'clock in the middle third of the breast immediately underlying
the subcutaneous fat. It shows a rapid heterogeneous initial
enhancement with washout. It is mostly isointense to the adjacent
breast parenchyma on T2 This corresponds therefore to that was
biopsied under ultrasound guidance.

There is also non-mass segmental enhancement of the entire upper
inner quadrant which shows also rapid initial enhancement with the
plateau. This measures 6.5 by 4.3 cm (images 57-69). This
extends from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock and implies the entire
thickness of the right breast in that area. It extends inferiorly
to the subareolar region (image 67) and may even extend to the
skin immediately above the nipple. It does not extend to the
nipple areolar complex.

No abnormality left breast.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

Known malignancy right breast at 12 o'clock, size of enhancement
larger than on ultrasound. (BI-RADS 6)

Also, associated non-mass segmental enhancement right breast,
possibly DCIS. Targeted ultrasound is suggested and if not seen
on ultrasound, MRI guided biopsy of the the furthest area can be
done. (BI-RADS 5)

dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging, including outside imaging from
Quantum Medical Imaging Services. EPR report describes an MRI
performed recently at Scarborough General Hospital however we do
not have the report or images.

FINDINGS: There is a large amount of breast tissue with a
moderate degree and marked intensity of enhancement; this limits
MRI sensitivity. Bilateral small multiple cysts.

Right upper outer posterior spiculated and lobulated enhancing
mass with washout of enhancement and with no chest wall invasion,
measuring 3.0 cm TV x 3.4 cm AP x 3.0 cm CC (3.9 cm from the
nipple).

Right lower inner posterior focal non mass enhancement measuring 8
x 7 mm (image 61); this is likely parenchymal.

Left upper inner posterior lobulated and angulated mass with mild
and plateauing enhancement. There are several surrounding
adjacent nodules with similar morphology and enhancement.
Altogether this measures 5.8 cm CC x 3.4 cm AP x 2.6 cm TV (the
dominant mass measures 5.0 x 2.1 x 2.6 cm, image 19).

Left lower inner posterior 2 small enhancing masses measuring 6
and 5 mm (image 17); these could be parenchymal.

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.

Multiple low signal liver lesions which are well defined and likely cysts.

IMPRESSION:

1. Background marked parenchymal enhancement limits MRI
sensitivity. Recommend bilateral whole breast ultrasound for
further evaluation.

2. Right upper outer mass, apparently this has already been
biopsied as invasive ductal cancer (if repeat biopsy is required,
please submit a requisition for this).

3. Right lower inner non mass enhancement which is likely
parenchymal. Recommend second look ultrasound. If not seen,
recommend 6 month follow up MRI.

3. Left upper inner mass, apparently this has already been
biopsied as LCIS. If this is the case, this is discordant. This
was seen on outside ultrasound and thus repeat ultrasound guided
core biopsy is recommended if previous biopsy did indeed show LCIS
(if so, please submit a requisition for this).

4. Left lower inner 2 masses which are indeterminate and possibly
parenchymal. Recommend second look ultrasound. If breast
conserving surgery is being contemplated, biopsy is recommended
(using ultrasound guidance if seen by ultrasound, or using MRI
guidance if not seen by ultrasound).

5. Liver lesions which are possibly cysts, recommend ultrasound
characterization.

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral mammogram and right breast ultrasound
of 04/18/2008

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of breat tissue. Little parenchymal enhancement.

Corresponding to the known malignancy in the right breast, there
is a rapidly irregular enhancing mass measuring 16 mm with washout
in the anterior third, slightly lateral to the nipple. No
corresponding T2 abnormality. No other areas of enhancement in
the right breast.

In the left breast, there are 3 foci of non-mass enhancement, in
the posterior third, the largest one mesures 1 cm. The entire
area mesures 3.4 by 3.2 cm. They show rapid initial enhancement
with plateau. They are located between 1 and 3 o'clock position.
No other areas of enhancement in the left breast.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.

IMPRESSION:

Known of malignancy right breast which seem uni-focal.

3 foci of non-mass enhancement left breast. Targeted sonographic
evaluation suggested. If not seen on ultrasound, consideration
should be given to MR guided biopsy to exclude the possibility of
DCIS.

Large polylobulated necrotic mass centered in the upper outer
quadrant of the right breast, measuring 12 (AP) x 10 (TRV) x 14
(SAG) cm, with nodular peripheral enhancement. The mass invades
the right pectoralis major muscle. Diffuse skin thickening over
the right breast. There is also a suspicion of skin invasion by
the tumor in the upper outer breast, near the axilla.

Inferiorly and laterally to the necrotic mass, there is a large
area of segmental non masslike avid and intense enhancement also
concerning for infiltrative process, measuring at least 5.6 (AP)

TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS:

There is minimal breast tissue with minimal and intensity and
minimal degree of diffuse stippled enhancement.

LEFT BREAST

Along the posterior nipple line on the left breast there is
prominent, asymmetric linear enhancement with an AP length of 5.0
cm. it extends medially and laterally, for a total width of 3.2
cm. Enhancement demonstrates dendritic extension around 1 to 2
fat adjacent lobules, along Cooper's ligaments. The nonmass
enhancement correlates with the mammographic distortion and
sonographic mass, which was recently biopsied, pathology is
pending.

Slightly prominent node left axilla, better evaluated
sonographically, which has been sampled recently.

RIGHT BREAST

No abnormal enhancement in the right breast. Right axilla clear.
IMPRESSION:

Suspicious morphologic enhancement in the left breast centrally.
Overall appearance is concerning for lobular carcinoma. This has
been recently biopsied, pathology pending. BIRADS 5.

REFERENCE EXAM: Right breast ultrasound and ductogram of
September 20 8009

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. No
significant background of parenchymal enhancement.

In the right breast, extending from the anterior to the middle
third of the breast , in the lower outer quadrant, between 8 and 9
o'clock position is an irregular mass which shows rapid initial
enhancement with washout. The mass measures 3.4 by 3 by 1.2 cm.
This is hypointense on T2. The irregular mass is associated with
clumped linear segmental enhancement. The mass and the clumped
linear enhancement measures 3.5 by 9 by 2.9 cm (images 67 to 76).
On the study before contrast, the ductal system draining the mass
in the lower outer quadrant appears hyperintense most likely
related to blood or proteinaceous material within the duct system.
The enhancement does not extend to the pectoralis muscle
posteriorly or to the nipple areolar complex anteriorly.

There are some foci of parenchymal enhancement particularly at 12
o'clock right breast as well as in the lower inner quadrant but no
other suspicious areas.

No abnormality left breast particularly in the area of the cluster
of microcalcifications in the upper inner quadrant.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

Highly suspicious mass associated with linear and segmental
clumped enhancement in the lower outer quadrant extending from 8
to 9 o'clock implying the anterior and middle third of the breast
in keeping quite extensive with multifocal disease. Biopsy of the
mass was already done under ultrasound guidance and proven to be
invasive ductal carcinoma. The linear clumped enhancement is most
likely related to associated DCIS. (BI-RADS 6)

No abnormality left breast but stereotactic guided core biopsy of
the cluster of microcalcifications seen on mammogram suggested.
BI-RADS 4

I remain available to discuss this case further with you if
additional biopsies are required in the right breast.

The case was discussed at rounds and with the referring physician.

The end result was:

1) Needs a lt sided stereo (scheduled for Thursday October
15th 2009)

2) needs also ultrasound-guided biopsy of right lower inner
quadrant lesion.

The appointments will be facilitated.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Known left locally advanced breast cancer.
LMP August 14/09

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
80, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.4) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.6, TR:7.2) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast( 6 cc) was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant with GD Swap
(TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram of August 14/09

FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense with a mild amount
and intensity background parenchymal enhancement. The known
malignancy is seen predominately in the left upper inner quadrant
but extends lateral to the nipple line. It measures approximately
6 cm in the SI dimension, 7.6 cm in the AP dimension and 3.5 cm in
the transverse dimension. It extends to the immediate subareolar
region although no abnormal nipple enhancement is seen. No
involvement of the pectoralis muscle is evident. No definitely
abnormal left axillary nodes are present.

On the right superior and lateral to the nipple line image 65
there is a focal area of linear non-mass enhancement showing a
rapid early and delayed plateau pattern measuring 1.6 cm in
length.
IMPRESSION: Large locally advanced left breast cancer. Axillary
nodes would be better evaluated with ultrasound. A requisition
should be sent. BI-RADS 6

Indeterminate non-mass enhancement in the right upper outer
quadrant is unlikely to the seen on ultrasound. Magnification
views of the area are recommended. If suspicious calcifications
are not identified an MRI guided vacuum assisted biopsy would be
recommended in this clinical setting. BI-RADS: 4

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: High risk screening LMP May 20

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic
runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using
VIBRANT (108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of
iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial
3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post
processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D
reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram 6/9/2009

FINDINGS:

Large volume severe, amount and intensity diffuse stippled
background enhancement limiting sensitivity.

In the left central subareolar breast, image 19, middle third,
there is a 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm mass with rapid initial in plateau
delayed and delayed plateau enhancement, with T2 signal greater
than adjacent background parenchyma. There are some areas of dark
T2 signal within, corresponding with areas of non enhancement
within the lesion. This is a possible fibroadenoma. Similarly on
image 14, superior and medial to the above lesion, there is a
lobulated mass with similar enhancement and T2 characteristics.
No corresponding mammographic findings, however breast density
limits mammographic correlation.

No concerning enhancement in the right breast.

0.2cm left internal mammary node, likely incidental. No
significant adenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

No MR evidence of malignancy in the right breast.

Large degree background enhancement limits sensitivity of this
MRI. Left subareolar mass (image 19), left upper inner mass,
possible fibroadenomas. This should be correlated with
ultrasound. If not seen sonographically suggest 6 month follow up
MRI. BIRADS 3.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspicious right breast mass and
calcifications. LMP June 30 2009.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 6 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: Large amount breast tissue with a moderate degree and
intensity of enhancement; this limits MRI sensitivity.

There is a spiculated enhancing mass in the right upper inner
posterior breast with a washout enhancement curve, 9.7 cm from the
nipple, 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm (image 63). This corresponds to the
mammographic/sonographic mass. However there is no MRI correlate
to the additional sonographic masses.

There is diffuse non mass regional enhancement occupying much of
the medial half of the right breast. This measures 10.8 cm CC x
5.8 cm AP x 3.0 cm TV (image 58). There is no involvement of the
nipple or chest wall. This corresponds to the mammographic
calcifications although appears more extensive.

No abnormal left breast mass or enhancement.

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: MRI sensitivity limited by background parenchymal
enhancement.

1. Right upper inner mass corresponding to the suspicious
mammographic/sonographic mass. Additional sonographic masses are
not seen on ultrasound. Ultrasound guided core biopsy is
recommended.

2. Right medial half non mass enhancement corresponding to the
mammographic calcifications (but more extensive). Stereotactic
core biopsy of the lower inner calcifications is recommended.

A verbal report will be sent and an appointment will be organized.

TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a large amount of breast tissue with a
moderate degree and intensity of enhancement. This limits MRI
sensitivity.

There are multiple bilateral breast cysts.

There are no abnormal lymph nodes.

Two low signal lesions in the central superior liver (versus
artifact), series 7 image 101.

RIGHT:

Central mass which is not T2 bright, with early enhancement and
washout. This measures 5 x 4 mm (4.4 cm from nipple, image 60).

LEFT:

Left lower inner posterior round slightly irregular breast mass
with only mild T2 bright signal, early enhancement, and washout.
This contains foci of non enhancing T1 and T2 bright signal,
likely representing hemorrhage from biopsy. This measures 1.3 AP
x 1.3 CC x 1.2 TV cm (3.3 cm from nipple, image 19).

Left lower outer posterior oval lobulated mass with T2 bright
associated signal and internal non enhancing septations, 9 x 7 mm
(7.0 cm from nipple, image 7). This shows early enhancement with
washout. This sits against the chest wall and biopsy with MR
guidance would be difficult.

Left inferior posterior 6 o'clock linear non mass enhancement with
slowly increasing enhancement over time, measuring 4.0 cm AP x 0.7
cm CC (3.5 cm from nipple, image 12).
IMPRESSION:

1. MRI sensitivity limited by background parenchymal enhancement.

2. Left lower inner mass corresponding to the known biopsy proven
cancer.

3. Left lower outer mass likely a fibroadenoma. Targeted
ultrasound correlation is recommended. If not seen by ultrasound,
recommend 6 month MRI follow up.

4. Left inferior non mass enhancement likely parenchyma.
Targeted ultrasound correlation is recommended. If not seen by
ultrasound, recommend 6 month MRI follow up.

5. Right central mass, nonspecific. Targeted ultrasound
correlation is recommended. If not seen by ultrasound, recommend
MRI guided biopsy.

6. As per the consultation report, recommend left mammographic
views, whole breast, and axilla ultrasound.

7. Questionable liver lesions (versus artifact). Recommend
targeted ultrasound (we will leave this to your office to arrange
for the patient).

BREAST MRI

Indication: dcis rt breast, pathology shows close margins assess
for extent of disease

Comparison examination:

Technique: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:76,
TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:8.1) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.6, TR:7.3) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus
injection. Axial Vibrant delayed with FS (TE:4, TR: 8.2) were then
obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP
3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Findings:

Scattered glandular tissue in both breasts with minimal
background enhancement.

In the left breast, no abnormal mass or enhancement.

In the right breast, changes consistent with a history of a
lumpectomy with a seroma present in the superior breast. Just
lateral, inferior and posterior to this cavity there is
non-masslike enhancement measuring 10 x 7 mm, demonstrating rapid
enhancement with a plateau type curve. This area of enhancement is
11 mm posterior and just lateral to the lumpectomy site.

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
Impression:

Non-masslike enhancement in the right breast posterior and lateral
to the previous resection. DCIS cannot be excluded and a biopsy
is recommended. Targeted ultrasound of this area inferior, lateral
and posterior to the lumpectomy site suggested and biopsied with
that modality if visualized. Otherwise an MRI guided biopsy
recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Left breast mass at two o'clock, pathology-
invasive ductal carcinoma. MRI for extent of disease.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:8.1) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.6, TR:7.3) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus
injection. Axial Vibrant Gd delayed with FS (TE 2.8, TR 5.7) and
axial Vibrant with GD Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.2) were then obtained.
Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D
reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Baseline MRI. Comparison is made with prior
ultrasound and mammogram.

FINDINGS: LMP: 07 September, 2008

Scattered amount of fibroglandular tissue is present bilaterally
with mild degree and intensity of heterogenous background
enhancement. Image quality is compromised by motion artifact.

Left breast: Known cancer in the left breast centrally laterally
and in the mid third at three o'clock. It appears as an irregular
non-mass persistently enhancing lesion of size 2.9 x 0.9 x 1.8 cm
AP, ML, SI, Image 15.
Along the nipple line, medially is another small 4mm enhancing
focus (Image 39).
No skin or chest wall involvement. No abnormal adenopathy.

Right breast: There is evidence of a linear non-mass enhancement
in the right upper outer quadrant within the anterior to mid third
breast, image 88, of length 2.6 cm.
There is another round enhancing mass, image 98, within the right
breast upper quadrant laterally of size 9 mm .

IMPRESSION: Left breast: 1.Irregular non-mass enhancement within
the left breast three o'clock, pathology proven invasive ductal
carcinoma.
2. Small enhancing 4 mm focus in the left breast medially and on
the nipple line. Targeted ultrasound is recommended and possible
biopsy.

Right breast:
1.Linear non-mass enhancement within the right upper outer
quadrant to be evaluated by ultrasound.
2. Round enhancing mass upper quadrant laterally to be evaluated
by targeted ultrasound and possible biopsy

We will facilitate the appointments.

with mild degree and intensity of heterogenous background
enhancement. Image quality is compromised by motion artifact.

Left breast: Known cancer in the left breast centrally laterally
and in the mid third at three o'clock. It appears as an irregular
non-mass persistently enhancing lesion of size 2.9 x 0.9 x 1.8 cm
AP, ML, SI, Image 15.
Along the nipple line, medially is another small 4mm enhancing
focus (Image 39).
No skin or chest wall involvement. No abnormal adenopathy.

Right breast: There is evidence of a linear non-mass enhancement
in the right upper outer quadrant within the anterior to mid third
breast, image 88, of length 2.6 cm.
There is another round enhancing mass, image 98, within the right
breast upper quadrant laterally of size 9 mm .

IMPRESSION: Left breast: 1.Irregular non-mass enhancement within
the left breast three o'clock, pathology proven invasive ductal
carcinoma.
2. Small enhancing 4 mm focus in the left breast medially and on
the nipple line. Targeted ultrasound is recommended and possible
biopsy.

Right breast:
1.Linear non-mass enhancement within the right upper outer
quadrant to be evaluated by ultrasound.
2. Round enhancing mass upper quadrant laterally to be evaluated
by targeted ultrasound and possible biopsy

We will facilitate the appointments.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Known right breast cancer.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: 10/05/2009

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue laterally. Minimal
degree and intensity of background parenchymal enhancement.

Corresponding to the area of microcalcifications in the upper
inner quadrant on the mammogram, there is a mass measuring
approximately 15 by 11 by 13 mm (images 55 to 59) in the posterior
third. This shows rapid initial enhancement with plateau. No
corresponding T2. This mass is in close proximity to the
pectoralis muscle but there is no invasion of the pectoralis.
This has been biopsied and shown to be invasive breast carcinoma.

On image 58, in the anterior third, at 3 o'clock is a lobulated 7
mm mass, located 2.3 cm inferior and 2.3 cm anterior to the
dominant mass. It shows a moderate initial and continuous
enhancement. No corresponding T2 signal This is however viewed
with concern and a DCIS cannot be excluded.

No other areas of enhancement in the right breast or for in the
left breast.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.


MPRESSION:

Known malignancy right upper inner quadrant corresponding to the
irregular enhancing mass on MRI. (BI-RADS 6)

Indeterminate mass in the same quadrant, in the anterior third,
approximately 2.5 cm from the dominant mass. Targeted ultrasound
suggested. If not seen on ultrasound, MRI guided biopsy
suggested. (BI-RADS 4)

breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No prior available for comparison.

FINDINGS:
There is marked amount of fibroglandular tissue. Moderate degree
and intensity of diffuse stippled background parenchymal
enhancement.
In the right upper outer quadrant posterior third (image 76),
there is an irregular mass with irregular margins measuring 1.9 AP
x 1.5 CC x 1.6 TV cm. This lies 4.7 cm deep to the nipple with
mild associated bright T2 signal with rapid initial and delayed
wash out rim-enhancement. This is surrounded by a homogenous
segmental non mass enhancement (3.0 AP x 2.1 CC x 1.9 TV cm, image
78) in the axillary tail which abuts and does not invade the right
pectoralis muscle. If this to be included, the total parenchymal
involvement measures 3.8 cm in AP dimension (axial image 66).
Anterior, inferior and medial to this at approximately 9 O'clock,
there is a microlobulated heterogenous mass (image 73) measuring
1.4 AP x 1.0 CC x 1.3 TV cm with associated bright T2 signal. This
lies 2.1 cm deep to the nipple in the middle third of the breast.

No suspicious focal mass, signal or enhancement in the left
breast.
Bilateral prominent axillary lymph nodes, more on the left, with
the largest in the left measuring 1.3 cm (in short axis, image 117
axial).

OPINION:
1.Large right breast upper outer quadrant mass corresponding to
the right breast biopsy proven carcinoma.
2.Right 9 o'clock breast lobulated indeterminate mass,
corresponding to the biopsy proven fat epithelial tissue with
atypia. This was biopsied today.
3.Bilateral mildly prominent nodes, right only slightly greater
than left.
Please note that right whole breast and bilateral axillary
ultrasound were performed. Right breast ultrasound guided biopsy
of the right 9 O'clock mass as well as FNA of a left axillary
lymph node were also performed. Please refer to that ultrasound
report.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Baseline mammogram and subsequent ultrasound showed

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a large amount of breast tissue with a marked
degree and moderate intensity of enhancement; this limits MRI
sensitivity.

Left central (slightly lateral) posterior spiculated mass with
delayed washout of contrast and associated distortion of breast
tissue, measuring 13 x 12 x 7 mm (image 22, 6.6 cm from the
nipple). Lying 1.0 cm lateral to this is a smaller vague
spiculated mass measuring 6 x 5 x 6 mm (image 17, 6.5 cm from the
nipple). These are likely the 2 masses seen sonographically.

In the posterior third of the left breast there is a third small
vague spiculated enhancing mass, measuring 6 mm and lying 3.9 cm
posterior and superior to the dominant mass (image 22).

No abnormal enhancement to correlate to the mammographic
calcifications.

No abnormal mass or enhancement in the right breast.

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. MRI sensitivity is limited by parenchymal enhancement.

2. Left upper outer breast contains one definite and two probable
masses, two of which were seen on ultrasound. Recommend second
look ultrasound to demonstrate the third mass.

3. As stated previously, ultrasound guided biopsy of the largest
left breast mass and stereotactic core biopsy of 2 clusters of
left calcifications, and ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration
of a left axillary lymph node are all recommended.

In the posterior third of the left breast there is a third small
vague spiculated enhancing mass, measuring 6 mm and lying 3.9 cm
posterior and superior to the dominant mass (image 22).

No abnormal enhancement to correlate to the mammographic
calcifications.

No abnormal mass or enhancement in the right breast.

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. MRI sensitivity is limited by parenchymal enhancement.

2. Left upper outer breast contains one definite and two probable
masses, two of which were seen on ultrasound. Recommend second
look ultrasound to demonstrate the third mass.

3. As stated previously, ultrasound guided biopsy of the largest
left breast mass and stereotactic core biopsy of 2 clusters of
left calcifications, and ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration
of a left axillary lymph node are all recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 39 year old. Pre-op to assess extent of
disease. The patient is to have bilateral mastectomy for locally
advanced disease on the left (10 cm infiltrating ductal) and DCIS
on the right. She has completed her neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
LMP end of October 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Prior imaging from an outside institution was
reviewed and included bilateral mammogram of 06/19/09, breast
ultrasound of 07/03/09, mammogram of 07/03/09 and biopsy images of
07/10/09. Prior MRI imaging was not available however the report
from 07/21/09 was reviewed.

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue showing a
large amount of moderate intensity enhancement.

No discrete mass is identified in the left breast. There is
diffuse asymmetric, non-mass enhancement which contains areas of
more intense enhancement throughout the entire left breast. As
there are no prior images for comparison, this presumable
represents residual disease and would correlate with the
previously diagnosed malignancy.

There is a discrete ring, enhancing mass in the 9 o'clock position
of the right breast (image 81) which likely does not correlate
with the site of prior stereotactic guided biopsy. The mass shows
rapid, progressive enhancement and has a central area of T2 signal
intensity but does not look like a cyst. There is a 4.7 mm focus
of enhancement (image 70) in the 12 o'clock position, posterior
1/3 which is high in signal intensity on T2 and likely represents
a small intramammary lymph node or fibroadenoma. There is no
definite correlate to the calcifications at the 11-12 o'clock
position that were biopsied and shown to be DCIS. There is signal
void in the medial right breast from the known port-a-cath.

There are no definite abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

1. There is no identifiable mass in the left breast there is
however diffuse non-mass enhancement which presumably represents
residual disease in the absence of prior MR images for comparison.
2. No correlate for the biopsied calcifications in the right
breast at 11-12 o'clock that were DCIS is identified.
3. Indeterminate ring enhancing, mass at the 9 o'clock position
in the right breast raises the possibility of another area of
malignancy.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Clinically apparent locally advanced breast
carcinoma on the left, pre-therapeutic workup

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic
runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using
VIBRANT (108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of
iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial
3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post
processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D
reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram from today, 8/13/2009

FINDINGS:

There is a large volume of moderate to large amount and severe
intensity and background heterogeneous regional enhancement
limiting assessment. Scattered cysts throughout both breasts
suggesting underlying fibrocystic change bilaterally.

There are multiple, lobulated hypervascular masses within the left
breast, with obvious nodular extension towards nipple, and in the
skin. Largest mass is in the left upper outer quadrant measuring
4.9 x 4.9 x 4.1 (w) cm, centered in the middle to posterior third
of the breast but extending into the anterior breast, &amp;lt;1cm from
skin. A second dominant mass in the left breast is in the lower
inner quadrant, 3.2 by 1.3 by 2.9 cm. There also multiple,
smaller masses scattered throughout the breast extending from the
posterior third of the breast through towards the nipple, with
obvious extension into the areola and surrounding skin. The skin
is thickened and edematous. There are multiple, necrotic
appearing matted nodes within the left axilla, largest
conglomerate measuring 3.0 x 2.1 cm (AP x W). These are present
along the entire visualized lateral margin of the pectoralis minor
muscle, as well as a smaller (1cm) but necrotic interpectoral node
and a 0.5cm internal mammary node.

The right breast is more difficult to evaluate given lack of
symmetry with the contralateral side.

There are two highly suspicious masses in the right upper outer
quadrant, both irregular in shape, angular margins which are
hypervascular with washout; image 75, 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8cm, abutting
a complex cyst, and the other immediately superolateral, image 78
1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8cm, with intense rim enhancement.

There is possible distortion in the upper medial breast, but there
is no definable mass, only confluent regional heterogeneous
enhancement and scattered cysts. There is some scattered
enhancement within the right areola, mild and subtle, best seen
medially and inferiorly on the axial sequence, uncertain
significance. No convincing subareaolar mass. Clinical
correlation regarding appearance of nipple/areolar complex.

Single borderline node right axilla, 1cm short axis, for
correlation with ultrasound.

OPINION:

Left breast heavy burden of disease above, with multicentric
masses, skin infiltration and extension to nipple. Bulky,
necrotic matted axillary adenopathy, interpectoral and internal
mammary nodes.

Right breast assessment is limited by background enhancement. At
least two highly suspicious masses right upper outer quadrant as
above. An attempt at localizing with ultrasound should be made,
as more anterior mass is associated with complex cyst, this will
likely be visible. Ultrasound guided core biopsy can then be
performed. This is in the area of malignant microcalcifications
seen mammographically.

Uncertain significance of very mild areolar enhancement as above.
Clinical correlation with visual appearance. Single borderline
node right axilla, which can be evaluated at the time of
ultrasound.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Biopsy proven left breast cancer for
staging.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 6 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior outside imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a large amount of breast tissue with a large
degree and moderate intensity of enhancement. This somewhat
limits MRI sensitivity. There are a few small scattered bilateral
cysts.

There is a left upper inner posterior spiculated enhancing mass
that corresponds to the known cancer seen mammographically and
sonographically, measuring 2.4 cm CC x 2.2 cm AP x 1.9 cm TV
(image 24). The enhancement pattern is plateauing. This lies 6.0
cm from the nipple and there is no chest wall involvement. There
is a linear non mass enhancement arising from the mass and
extending anteriorly by 2.3 cm (image 26) which is worrisome for
duct extension. This does not extend to the nipple. There is
slight dimpling of the skin over this site however there is no
abnormal mass or enhancement extending to the skin.

No other abnormal left breast mass or enhancement is seen.

Three right breast lesions are seen, all with corresponding T2
bright signal. They are as follows:
- 6 o'clock - 2.3 cm from nipple - 8 x 4 mm (image 66) - linear
non mass enhancement
- 12 o'clock - 8.6 cm from nipple - 10 x 7 mm (image 64) -
reniform shaped mass, possibly a lymph node
- 9 o'clock - 4.3 cm from nipple - 6 x 5 mm (image 60) - well
defined mass, possibly a fibroadenoma

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Left upper inner breast mass in keeping with the known breast
cancer. Anterior ductal extension but no extension to skin,
nipple, or chest wall. Outside report indicates a breast
ultrasound was performed, but does not indicate an axillary
ultrasound was performed. Repeat ultrasound documentation of the
known mass and axillary ultrasound is recommended. Please submit
a requisition for this, and an appointment will be facilitated.

2. Three right breast lesions, likely benign. Recommend second
look ultrasound of all 3 lesions. If not seen by ultrasound,
recommend 6 month MRI follow up. Please submit a requisition for
this, and an appointment will be facilitated.

LMP: September 24, 2009 . Day 5 .

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Previous breast imaging including bilateral
mammogram and left breast and axillary ultrasound on September 23,
2009 .

FINDINGS:
There is a large amount of fibroglandular breast tissue.
High degree of moderate intensity background parenchymal
enhancement. The MRI was performed on day 5 of the menstrual
cycle. That significantly reduce the sensitivity of the MRI.

Significant motion artefacts that decrease the sensitivity of the
contrast enhanced and subtracted series (the patient has sneezed
x3 after contrast injection).


Bilateral subcentimetric simple cysts and ectatic ducts containing
proteinaceous material.

Left-
Large area of marked clustered ring-like non-masslike regional
enhancement occupying most of the left upper outer quadrant. This
area involve the immediate subareolar region up to the posterior
third of the breast, measuring at least 11.5 x 6.7 x 3.8 cm .
This is suspicious for infiltrative disease. No definite evidence
of nipple or chest wall invasion.

The ultrasound described suspicious masses are difficult to see
through this regional a non-masslike enhancement due to a similar
degree of enhancement. The 12 o'clock mass at 3 cm from the
nipple, corresponds to an area of parenchymal distortion and an
enhancing mass measuring 2 .6 x 1 .8 0 .9 cm (image 19). There is
no definite MRI correlate for the ultrasound finding in the 2
o'clock position at 8cm from the nipple.

In the medial subareolar area (image 24), the previously described
palpable mass corresponds to a 13.5 x 10.5 x 10.0 mm progressively
enhancing mass, with corresponding bright T2 signal and internal
dark unenhancing septations. These MRI characteristics are
suggestive of a fibroadenoma.

Right-
Due to the high amount of background enhancement, the right breast
is difficult to accurately assess. Multiple foci of heterogenous
enhancement are seen and this is probably physiologic and due to
the improper timing of the MRI. However, there is no area of
enhancement as avid as in the contralateral breast.

In the left axilla, there is two lymph nodes with thicken cortex.
One 3mm left internal mammary node is also seen.

OPINION:
1. High amount of background enhancement and significant motion
artifacts are reducing the sensitivity of the exam.
2. Regional non-masslike enhancement involving all the left upper
outer quadrant, with associated mass, corresponding to the
sonographic finding. Highly suspicious calcifications are found in
this area and a stereotactic guided core biopsy is suggested. The
ultrasound mass in the 12 o'clock position can also be biopsied
under ultrasound guidance. BI-RADS 5
3. Palpable probably benign mass in the left medial subareolar
region, most likely to represent a fibroadenoma. Depending of the
surgical approach a 6 months ultrasound can be performed. Bi-RADS
3
4. Two abnormal left axillary lymph nodes. FNA under ultrasound
guidance of one of them is suggested as per previous report.
5. Multiple foci of heterogenous enhancement are seen in the
right breast and this is probably physiologic and due to the
suboptimal timing of the MRI relating to the menstrual cycle.
However, no definite area suspicious for malignant disease on the
right side. A 6 months follow-up breast MRI properly timed to week
2 of the menstrual cycle recommended. BI-RADS: 3

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Left lumpectomy August 13, 2009 with chest wall
invasion. Post menopausal.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Previous outside imaging not available.

FINDINGS: Small amount breast tissue with a mild degree and
intensity enhancement.

Left upper outer quadrant post operative seroma 4.2 x 3.3 x 2.1
cm, surrounded by a thin rim of normal enhancement. Abnormal non
mass segmental enhancement extends from the posterior margin
posterior to the chest wall, measuring roughly 3.3 cm AP x 2.0 cm
CC x 1.5 cm TV (image 17). Enhancement abuts the lateral margin
of the left pectoralis major and minor muscles and the anterior
aspect of the chest wall. No definite invasion into the chest
wall/muscles is seen, but this cannot be excluded.

Multiple enhancing satellite nodules are seen around the seroma.
All lie within 1.0 cm of the seroma. These show slightly
irregular margins, early arterial enhancement, and delayed
washout, in keeping with malignancy:
- Upper outer quadrant anterior to seroma - at least 3 nodules,
largest 0.5 cm (image 21)
- Upper outer quadrant posterior to seroma - at least 2 nodules,
1.2 x 1.2 cm and 1.2 x 1.0 cm (image 18)
- Inferior (6 o'clock) to seroma - at least 1 nodule, 1.0 cm
(image 21).

Left medial anterior breast (at areola) 4 mm focus of enhancement
which does not wash out (image 27).

Left axillary 1.3 x 0.8 cm round mass in keeping with a lymph
node, deep to the pectoralis major muscle (image 21).

Right breast shows no abnormal mass or enhancement. No abnormal
right lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Previous left lumpectomy and seroma with posterior non mass
enhancement extending posteriorly to abut the chest wall, invasion
is not seen but cannot be completely excluded.

2. Multiple satellite nodules surround the seroma, most in the
upper outer quadrant but one in the inferior 6 o'clock position;
all very suspicious for residual disease. Recommend whole breast
ultrasound and core biopsy of a dominant nodule in the upper outer
and lower breast. Please submit requisitions for this.

3. Left medial enhancing focus, indeterminate as it has a
different pattern of enhancement compared to the other nodules.
Ultrasound correlation recommended.

4. Previous imaging is not available. We will attempt to obtain
this and dictate an addendum if it arrives. If not, right
mammogram follow up is recommended in 1 year from the previous.

September 2009, March 2008 and July 2006. Workup right breast
Peterborough Regional Health Center including magnification views
and ultrasound right breast and axilla.

Findings: There is heterogeneously dense tissue lateral right
breast. At the 8-9 o'clock there is a partially obscured
approximately 3.5 cm irregular mass with suspicious pleomorphic
calcifications. This mass has developed in an area of longstanding
asymmetrical breast tissue. There is an enlarged low axillary
node. On the outside magnification views the calcifications
appeared confined to the mass but additional magnification views
to include the nipple area recommended to assess extent of
calcifications.

FINDINGS: scattered fibroglandular tissue with a large area
asymmetry lateral right breast. Mild degree of moderate intensity
scattered stippled background enhancement.

In the right breast, images 73-87, there is an irregular enhancing
mass that corresponds to the mammographic and ultrasound findings
and the biopsy proven carcinoma. This is located at 8-9 o'clock
lateral right breast and measures 31 SI x 27 AP x 46 TR mm.

In the posterior third of the right breast image 78, 11 o'clock,
is an 8 mm mildly irregular enhancing mass, mildly hyperintense on
T2, with rapid initial and delayed plateau enhancement. This is
located 5 cm from the carcinoma and may be a satellite lesion.

There are grossly enlarged and abnormal appearing right axillary
lymph nodes the largest measuring 42 mm. There are two other
probably replaced nodes measuring 23 and 33 mm. There are smaller
abnormal appearing nodes as well. These appear to be level I but
the axilla is distorted by patient positioning. These extend into
the lateral interpectoral area. No definite level II or III nodes.
No evidence of chest wall or nipple involvement.

No significant enhancement left breast.

OPINION:

No suspicious mammographic or MRI lesions left breast.

Biopsy proven carcinoma lateral right breast maximum dimension 46

76.1, TR:2500) fat saturated images, Sagittal VIBRANT without Fat
Saturation (TE: 4.2, TR: 7.2), pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3
mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of IV
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial
VIBRANT with gad and axial VIBRANT with Gad Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction
and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison with previous imaging.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with moderate
degree of mild to moderate intensity heterogeneous background
parenchymal enhancement. This limits MRI sensitivity.

There are bilateral breast cysts.

Within the superior medial right breast, middle third (image 71),
there is a lobulated mass with smooth margins and no corresponding
T2 signal measuring 0.5 cm. It demonstrates rapid initial with
plateau delayed enhancement. There is a second 0.7 cm mass with
ill-defined margins and no corresponding T2 in the superior medial
right breast anteriorly (image 63). No other suspicious signal or
enhancement is noted in the right breast.

There is no abnormal signal or enhancement in the left breast.

There is no lymphadenopathy.

IMPRESSION:

1. Two enhancing masses in the superior medial right breast are
probably benign. Recommend second-look targeted ultrasound. If
there is no sonographic correlate, then recommend six month
follow-up MRI timed to the second week of the menstrual cycle.

2. No MRI evidence of malignancy in the left breast.

CLINICAL INDICATION: 38 year old with prior left mastectomy
(2008) for IDC with 2/9 positive nodes. Increasing calcifications
in the right breast. LMP March 2009. On Tamoxifen.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison is made to prior imaging. There are
no prior MRIs for comparison.

FINDINGS:

There has been prior left mastectomy. There are no masses or
areas of abnormal enhancement in the chest wall.

The right breast has a moderate amount of breast tissue which does
not show any significant background enhancement. There is a
small, 3.5 mm focus of non mass enhancement in the lower outer
quadrant of the right breast which shows rapid early enhancement
with plateau. There is no corresponding mammographic abnormality
and this does not correlate with the known microcalcifications.
There is no abnormal enhancement to correlate with the area of
known microcalcifications.

There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

1. Indeterminate focus of enhancement in the lower outer quadrant
of the right breast. Targeted ultrasound is suggested. If no
abnormality is identified then a repeat MRI is suggested in 6
months.
2. No MR correlate for the microcalcifications seen at
mammography. As before, stereotactic guided core biopsy is
suggested for the calcifications in the upper inner right breast
and lower inner right breast with vacuum assistance.

A verbal report will be called to the referring clinician's office
and an appointment will be facilitated upon receipt of the
requisition.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspion of multifocal cancer right breast.
For extent of disease and contralateral breast assessment. Remote
benign biopsy right upper breast. LMP Aug 26/09

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:8.6) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.7, TR:7.8) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (5 cc) was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant with GD Swap
(TE:4, TR: 8.2) was then obtained. Post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogam from DC Diagnosticare Unionville
10.09.2009

FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense with a moderate
amount of moderate intensity heterogeneous background parenchymal
enhancement. There are high T2 signal ducts in the subareolar
region bilaterally. In the left breast slightly lateral to the
nipple line in the 3 o'clock radius middle third image 12 there is
a rapidly enhancing irregular 5 mm mass showing a delayed washout
pattern.

In the right breast there are multiple suspicious enhancing masses
extending from image 64 medially to image 72 laterally. These are
predominantly in the upper outer quadrant but extend medial and
just inferior to the nipple line. The AP extent disease is
approximately 4.5 cm with an SI dimension of about 4 cm and almost
3 cm in transverse dimension. No involvement of the pectoralis
muscle or nipple areolar complex is seen although to the disease
does extend to the immediate superior subareolar region. In the
axial projection image 142 in the right subpectoral location there
is a 9 mm round masslike density. This is possibly vascular
although an abnormal node could be considered. No adenopathy is
otherwise seen.
IMPRESSION: Multiple masses in the right breast suspicious for
multifocal malignancy. Questionable lesion in the subpectoral
region on the axial view for which a CT chest may be helpful.
Right breast and axillary ultrasound with core biopsy has been
requested. Biopsy of different quadrants could be done if
necessary.

On the left there is a small suspicious mass. Left breast and
axillary ultrasound is suggested with a view to biopsy if the
small mass can be identified on ultrasound. Otherwise MRI guided
biopsy would be recommended.

Other work-up as previously suggested.

INDICATION: Right breast cancer. Extent of disease. Mother with
breast cancer age 55. LMP February 8 2010.

Outside ultrasound guided core biopsy of 2 masses (12 and 1
o'clock), pathology report of invasive ductal cancer.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of breast tissue with a mild
degree and intensity of enhancement.

Right breast:
- 12 o'clock anterior spiculated enhancing mass, 4.4 AP x 4.2 CC x
2.6 TV cm (image 71). Not T2 bright, rapidly enhancing with wash
out. Extends up to but not into the nipple. This mass lies
centrally and therefore involves all 4 quadrants.
- Upper inner posterior spiculated enhancing mass, 3.6 AP x 2.9 CC
x 2.9 TV cm (image 66). Not T2 bright, rapidly enhancing with
wash out. Lies only 0.4 cm apart from the 12 o'clock mass (image
69).
- Innumerable enhancing satellite nodules around both masses,
involving all 4 quadrants but most in the upper inner quadrant.
Some extend posterior up to but not into the pectoralis muscle.
Including these satellite lesions, overall disease extent is
difficult to measure but is approximately 9.2 cm CC (image 68) x
7.5 cm AP (image 66) x 4.9 cm TV (series 6 image 117).

Left breast:
- 6 o'clock posterior 4 mm enhancing focus, with T2 bright signal
and increasing enhancement over time, likely a lymph node or
fibroadenoma (image 13)
- central/slightly medial posterior lobulated mass with T2 bright
signal non non enhancing internal septations, with increasing
enhancement over time, likely a fibroadenoma - 7 x 7 x 7 mm (image
15)

Lymph nodes:
- There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right axilla
level 1, with thick cortex and loss of fatty hila. The largest
measures 1.1 cm in diameter.
- There are 2 small lymph nodes in the upper and mid right
internal mammary chain, largest 4 mm in short axis diameter, of
uncertain clinical significance.

There is a small right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right breast multifocal multicentric disease with 2 dominant
masses and multiple satellite masses involving all 4 quadrants.
Masses extend up to but not into the nipple. Satellite masses
extend up to but not into the pectoralis muscle.

2. Right enlarged axillary lymph nodes (level 1) which are
suspicious, and 2 small right internal mammary chain lymph nodes
which are indeterminate.

3. Left breast 2 small masses which are probably benign, suspect
fibroadenomas. Targeted left breast ultrasound did not reveal a
corresponding lesion (please refer to the ultrasound report of
today). Recommend 6 month MRI follow up.

4. Bilateral breast ultrasound and right axillary lymph node fine
needle aspiration were performed today, please refer to that
report.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 36 years-old female.Probable large right
breast carcinoma. Evaluate extent of disease.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Previous breast imaging including recent
mammograms and ultrasound February 2010. Baseline MRI.


LMP: February 12, 2010.

FINDINGS:
There is a large amount of fibroglandular breast tissue.
Marked degree of high intensity background parenchymal
enhancement, which limits the sensitivity of the test.

Multiple bilateral cysts measuring up to approximately 1 cm, some
showing rim enhancement, in keeping with complicated cysts.

LEFT-
In the left upper inner quadrant (image 23), there is a 12 mm cyst
with avidly enhancing solid component, measuring 1.1 x 1.2 x 1.0
and extending within the surrounding breast tissue along its
superior aspect. There is no other concerning findings in the left
breast.

RIGHT-
Large heterogeneously enhancing microlobulated mass in the right
upper outer quadrant of the right breast, corresponding to the
palpable finding. This measures 2.3 x 3.0 x 1.9 cm (image 73). No
evidence of chest wall, nipple or skin invasion. This mas will be
biopsied under ultrasound guidance today.

In the right upper outer quadrant, approximately in the 10 o'clock
position, there is a bean shaped avidly enhancing mass with bright
T2 signal, that may represent an abnormal lymph node with thicken
cortex. This measures 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm (image 77).

In the lower breast, approximately in the 6 o'clock position,
there is a 0.7 cm enhancing mass with no corresponding T2 signal,
adjacent to a bilobed cyst (image 74). This appearence can be
created by volume averaging with rim enhancing cyst wall, but
targeted ultrasound will be performed.

In the upper right breast, approximately in the 12-1 o'clock
position there is a 0.8 x 0.7 cm enhancing mass with no
corresponding T2 signal (image 71). This is adjacent to a cyst and
only 9 mm to the dominant mass in the prone position. Targeted
ultrasound will be performed.

No other suspicious finding in the right breast.

No suspicious lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right dominant suspicious mass.Ultrasound guided core
biopsy is planned today.
2. Three additional MRI enhancing masses are seen within the right
breast and targeted ultrasound will be performed today. The need
for biopsy of these masses will be determined after the ultrasound
taking into account the mammographic, ultrasound and MRI data.
3. Left complex mass. Targeted ultrasound will be performed today
and it there is a correlate to this lesion, core biopsy will then
be performed.

palpable finding. This measures 2.3 x 3.0 x 1.9 cm (image 73). No
evidence of chest wall, nipple or skin invasion. This mas will be
biopsied under ultrasound guidance today.

In the right upper outer quadrant, approximately in the 10 o'clock
position, there is a bean shaped avidly enhancing mass with bright
T2 signal, that may represent an abnormal lymph node with thicken
cortex. This measures 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm (image 77).

In the lower breast, approximately in the 6 o'clock position,
there is a 0.7 cm enhancing mass with no corresponding T2 signal,
adjacent to a bilobed cyst (image 74). This appearence can be
created by volume averaging with rim enhancing cyst wall, but
targeted ultrasound will be performed.

In the upper right breast, approximately in the 12-1 o'clock
position there is a 0.8 x 0.7 cm enhancing mass with no
corresponding T2 signal (image 71). This is adjacent to a cyst and
only 9 mm to the dominant mass in the prone position. Targeted
ultrasound will be performed.

No other suspicious finding in the right breast.

No suspicious lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right dominant suspicious mass.Ultrasound guided core
biopsy is planned today.
2. Three additional MRI enhancing masses are seen within the right
breast and targeted ultrasound will be performed today. The need
for biopsy of these masses will be determined after the ultrasound
taking into account the mammographic, ultrasound and MRI data.
3. Left complex mass. Targeted ultrasound will be performed today
and it there is a correlate to this lesion, core biopsy will then
be performed.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Right axillary node excised with metastatic
breast adenocarcinoma LMP about 3 weeks ago

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images
(TE:3.5, TR:7.1) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast
were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2,
under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(7 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammograms of 2010

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue with a mild
amount of moderate intensity diffuse background parenchymal
enhancement. There are small cysts bilaterally. There is post
operative distortion in the right axilla. No suspicious lesion is
seen in the left breast.

On the right there is no obvious malignancy. On image 61 there is
a cluster of small nodules producing non-mass enhancement
posteriorly and slightly inferiorly to the nipple line. This
shows a rapid early and delayed plateau enhancement.

On image 68 slightly lateral to the right nipple line at the
junction of the middle and posterior thirds there is a 5 mm
circumscribed mass with a nonenhancing internal septation showing
rapid early and progressive delayed enhancement. There is no
associated high T2 signal.

On the axial series there are at least 3 large abnormal right
axillary nodes measuring up to 2.6 cm in diameter. One of these
is extending posterior to pectoralis minor
IMPRESSION: Multiple abnormal level 1 and level 2 right axillary
nodes. Further evaluation of the right breast with additional
mammographic views and ultrasound is suggested. If no suspicious
lesion is identified for biopsy or to correlate to the MRI
findings, MRI guided vacuum assisted biopsies would be
recommended.

INDICATION: Surveillance. Right lumpectomy April 2009 with
axillary node dissection, radiation, chemotherapy, and tamoxifen.
BRCA 2 variant. LMP February 20, 2010.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a small amount of breast tissue with mild
degree/intensity enhancement.

Right post operative change including asymmetric increased
enhancement and diffuse skin thickening, likely post therapeutic.
There are 3 focal areas of non mass enhancement in the lower outer
quadrant scar tissue, which have no T2 bright correlate and show
increasing enhancement over time:
- focal, center of scar, 5 x 6 x 5 mm (image 83)
- linear, superior edge of scar, 20 x 5 x 5 mm (image 114)
- linear, inferior edge of scar, 17 x 5 x 7 mm (image 136).

No abnormal mass or enhancement in the left breast.

Right internal mammary node measuring 3 mm, nonspecific. No other
significant lymphadenopathy.

OPINION:

1. Post therapeutic changes in the right breast with focal areas
of enhancement within the scar tissue. While this may be post
therapeutic, MRI guided biopsy of one lesion (image 83) is
recommended. Please submit a requisition for this to our
department.

2. Note is made of a nonspecific tiny right internal mammary
lymph node. This can be followed at the time of subsequent MRI.

In the lower inner left breast, mid third image 28 is a 10 x 6 mm
oval enhancing mass with moderate initial and delayed plateau
enhancement, moderate T2 signal, non enhancing septations. This is
likely a fibroadenoma.

OPINION: No suspicious enhancement either breast particularly
upper outer quadrant left breast and stereotactic core biopsy of
the asymmetry and distortion has been recommended and this
appointment will be facilitated.

Probable benign enhancing mass lower inner left breast and
targeted US recommended and the appointment will be facilitated.
If not seen on US then follow up MRI in six months recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: BRCA 2. High risk screening. LMP April 28,
2010.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: There are no prior MRIs for comparison.

FINDINGS:

There is a large amount of breast tissue showing a mild degree of
stippled background enhancement.

In the lower outer quadrant of the right breast there is a 17 x 16
mm focal, area of asymmetric non-mass enhancement which shows
progressive enhancement. There is a small, T2 bright, 3 mm mass
in the right outer breast, posterior third (image 64) which shows
rapid enhancement and washout and has a fatty hilum.

No abnormality is identified in the left breast.

There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

1. Focal, asymmetric, non mass enhancement in the right breast is
most likely parenchymal in origin. A 6 month follow-up MRI is
suggested targeted to the 2nd week of the menstrual cycle
menstrual cycle.
2. Small, mass in the posterior, outer, right breast is most
likely a small lymph node.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Right inferior palpable mass.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:

FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

PREVIOUS: Outside bilateral mammogram from July 22 2010.

FINDINGS: Small amount breast tissue with mild degree/intensity
enhancement.

Right breast 6 o'clock posterior contains a round mass with
spiculated margins and an enhancing rim with washout and central
increasing enhancement; the central portion is T2 bright. Overall
this measures 2.2 AP x 2.0 CC x 2.4 TV cm and lies 9.9 cm from the
nipple (image 67). This abuts but does not invade the chest
wall/pectoralis major muscle. Extending anteriorly from the mass
is linear non mass enhancement which is T2 bright, measuring 3.6
AP x 1.2 CC x 0.9 TV cm, and ending 6.4 cm from the nipple (image
68). There is an additional focus of enhancement lying at the
anterior end of the linear enhancement measuring 0.5 cm and lying
4.4 cm anterior to the mass and 5.2 cm from the nipple (image 68).

Right upper outer middle third focus of non mass enhancement with
irregular margins, T2 bright signal and decreasing enhancement
over time, measuring 9 x 6 x 5 mm and lying 4.5 cm from the nipple
(image 78).

Left breast contains several small foci of enhancement with
associated T2 bright signal (these lesions are indicated with
arrows on series 21).

No significant lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right breast 6 o'clock mass, with anterior enhancement and a
small enhancing focus which is possibly a satellite lesion, all
suspicious for disease. Recommend right spot compression and
magnification views. Whole right breast and axilla ultrasound is
recommended, as well as ultrasound guided biopsy of the mass.
Please submit a requisition for this to our department.

2. Right upper outer focus of enhancement, nonspecific. If seen
by ultrasound, suggest ultrasound guided biopsy. If not, suggest
MRI guided biopsy. Please submit a requisition for this to our
department.

3. Left breast contains small foci of enhancement, likely benign
lymph nodes and/or fibroadenomas. Suggest whole breast
ultrasound. If not seen by ultrasound, recommend MRI follow up in
6 months.

If there is no additional report within 1 month, please contact
our department.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Left breast Ca 1 o'clock. Outside MRI
images describe three separate lesions around mass and left lower
outer left breast enhancement significance unknown

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic
runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using
VIBRANT (108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of
iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial
3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post
processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D
reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No previous imaging available. Unfortunately,
even the patient's previous mammograms are not available at the
time of reporting.

FINDINGS:

Mild volume and degree of mild intensity background parenchymal
enhancement bilaterally.

RIGHT BREAST:

Three nonspecific areas of enhancement;

1) smooth, short segment linear enhancement, image 79, 0.6cm lower
outer quadrant.
2) T2 bright ovoid mass laterally in the right breast around 3
o'clock, image 80, 0.7cm, possibly tiny fibroadenoma, enhances
early and plateaus
3) Circumscribed lobulated mass upper outer breast, image 77, 0.7
x 0.5 x 0.5cm. Mass is hypervascular early and heterogeneously
enhances, with some areas progressively brightening with time, one
nodular region possibly washing out, possible fibroadenoma but
indeterminate.

LEFT BREAST:

There is a 1.8 x 1.6 x 2.1cm spiculated hypervascular mass in the
middle third of the left breast centrally along the posterior
nipple line. There is thin, smooth linear enhancement extending
directly from the mass anteriorly into the nipple which is
indeterminate but suspicious.

There is a large volume of associated hypervascular, clumped
linear non-mass enhancement in a segmental distribution in the
left lower outer quadrant, extending from the posterior third to
the anterior third of the breast, spanning an AP diameter of
approximately 8cm in length x 1.7cm in width, all lateral to the
known malignancy. Enhancement extends toward but not into the
nipple anteriorly, clear of chest wall posteriorly by
approximately 1cm.

No axillary adenopathy. Indeterminate 0.3cm internal mammary
node.
IMPRESSION:

I assume the patient has had outside mammograms, as none are
available on our system for correlation. Unfortunately, none were
found today in the film library.

Known left breast Ca centered along the posterior nipple line in
the middle third of the breast, BIRADS 6. Large area of
associated suspicious non-mass enhancement in the lower outer
quadrant. If clinically relevant, this can be sampled to prove
large volume of associated disease, BIRADS 5. Second look
ultrasound and correlation with mammography suggested.

Left breast nonspecific areas of enhancement. Favor these will
likely be benign, suggest correlation with second look ultrasound
and US bx (or MRI biopsy as needed) of largest lobulated lesion in
the right upper outer breast. BIRADS 4.

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral mammogram of July 6th 2010

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Moderate
degree and intensity of stippled enhancement of the right breast.

In the left breast, there is marked asymmetric segmental
enhancement which implies the superior portion of the left breast,
medially and laterally, entire thickness of the breast,. The
inferior portion of the breasts is spared. The area of
enhancement measures 6.3 by 7.4 by 4.5 cm ((SI X AP X TV). Some
of the enhancement shows rapid initial with continuous enhancement
and other selected areas show washout. Particularly, a mass like
area in the subareolar region on image 11. The enhancement does
not extend to the nipple and areola complex or to the pectoralis
muscle.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

No suspicious areas of enhancement left breast in this patient
with a serous nipple discharge. The previous ultrasound and
mammogram are negative. MRI guided biopsy of at least 2 areas
suggested to to exclude malignancy. The most superior and the
most inferior area can be targeted.

Please submit appropriate requisition to schedule a biopsies.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Further evaluation of right upper outer
quadrant distortion and calcifications, prior to recommended core
biopsy.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained. Kinetic curve analysis was performed.

REFERENCE EXAM: Baseline mammograms March, 2009 and mammograms
and ultrasound April, 2009.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue throughout both
breasts. No significant background parenchymal enhancement.

Occupying much of the upper outer quadrant, middle and posterior
1/3s of the right breast is asymmetric, abnormal heterogeneous and
clumped regional enhancement (images 70 to 77). The dimensions of
involvement are 3.4 x 3.4 x 3 cm (SI x transverse x AP). The most
lateral aspect is an irregular heterogeneously enhancing focal
area measuring 2.5 x 1.4 x 2.7 cm (image 76) with associated
distortion and corresponds to be sonographically identified mass
and area of distortion on the mammograms. Clumped linear
enhancement between this dominant area and a more medial located
clumped focal enhancing area at approximately 12:30-1 o'clock,
measuring 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm (image 70). This more medial area
corresponds to the mammographic suspicious macrocalcifications.
The abnormality demonstrates overall a mild to moderate degree of
enhancement, mild initial and persistent delayed enhancement. One
internal focus demonstrates moderate initial and plateau delayed
enhancement. No evidence of nipple or chest wall involvement. A
few internal scattered cysts in the vicinity, correlating to the
ultrasound findings.

There are 2 additional tiny enhancing foci including posteriorly 9
o'clock right breast (image 78) measuring 2 mm and upper outer
quadrant, middle 1/3 (image 75) measuring 3 mm.

In the posterior lateral left breast at 3 o'clock (image 12) is an
oval mass with smooth margins and low signal internal septations,
mild initial and persistent delayed enhancement measuring 7 mm,
isointense on T2 favored as a fibroadenoma. Additional 3 mm
enhancing focus central breast (image 17), moderate initial and
persistent delayed enhancement, with a small focus of fat on the
non-subtracted T1 weighted images, possible tiny intramammary
lymph node. Smooth mild linear enhancement anterior 9 o'clock
left breast (image 23) measuring 1 cm, mild initial and persistent
delayed enhancement.

No abnormal lymph nodes.

Nonenhancing circumscribed hepatic mass measuring 1 cm, bright T2
signal, probable cyst in segment 4/8.

OPINION: Indeterminant - suspicious regional non-mass lesion
involving much of the upper outer quadrant right breast,
corresponding to the area of microcalcifications on mammography
and distortion and sonographic mass.

Arrangements have been made for ultrasound and stereotactic guided
biopsies of both abnormalities.

Additional findings include probable fibroadenoma lateral left
breast and a few additional probably benign enhancing foci in both
breasts and probable linear parenchymal enhancement left breast.
Targeted ultrasound of the left breast 3 o'clock probable
fibroadenoma is recommended. If not sonographically visible,
six-month follow-up MRI of this and the additional probably
non-mass lesions recommended.

88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging (from Scarborough Hospital).

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of breast tissue with a mild
degree and moderate intensity of enhancement. There are mild
bilateral post operative changes. A few small cysts are seen
bilaterally.

Left lower outer non mass segmental enhancement in a stippled
pattern with progressive enhancement which corresponds to the most
suspicious cluster of calcifications mammographically. This
measures 9.0 cm AP x 4.7 cm CC x 6.0 cm TV and does not extend to
the nipple (image 20).

Right central (slightly lateral) vague focal non mass enhancement,
calcifications are seen diffusely in the breast, also involving
this site. This measures 14 x 9 x 5 mm (image 80, 6.1 cm from the
nipple).

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower outer non mass segmental enhancement corresponding
to the most suspicious calcifications on the left.

2. Right central small area of non mass enhancement which could
be parenchymal.

3. Recommend left breast ultrasound and bilateral stereotactic
core biopsies, as per the consultation report.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

Indication: Right breast biopsy August 2008 for
microcalcifications. Pathology reveals atypical lobular
hyperplasia. Biopsy site was right upper inner quadrant. LMP Oct
16/08

The MRI is ordered pre-surgical excision to exclude concurrent
disease.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
84, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.4, TR:6.9) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (7 cc) was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec. Axial Vibrant Gd delayed with FS (TE 2.8,
TR 5.7) and axial Vibrant with GD Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.3) were then
obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP
\T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison: No previous MRI. Ultrasound July 2008. Multiple
prior mammograms.

Findings: Breast tissue is heterogeneously dense with diffuse
hetereogenous and stippled enhancement of moderate degree and
intensity. Signal void artifact related to the post biopsy clip
is noted on image 57 in the right upper inner quadrant. High T1
signal pre-contrast ducts bilaterally.

There are multiple bilateral cysts. One of the larger cysts is
seen on the right (image 22) measuring 13.5 mm.

Multiple bilateral enhancing foci are seen as follows:
Left breast
1. Image 8, three o'clock middle third measuring 4 mm. This
lesion demonstrates high T2 with rapid early and mild washout
pattern. This could be a node.
2. Image 15, 12 o'clock posteriorly measuring 4 mm. This lesion
exhibits high T2 signal with rapid early and delayed plateau
pattern.

Right breast
1. Image 70, RUOQ posteriorly 6 mm round mass exhibiting washout
enhancement characteristics. This mass is intermediate to high
signal intensity on T2 with rapid early and delayed washout.
2. Image 73, RUOQ measuring approximately 7 mm. Oval-shaped
well-circumscribed mass with high T2 signal intensity. This
exhibits washout on dynamic imaging.

Site of biopsy right upper inner quadrant is seen, with mild
underlying architectural distortion and increased T2 signal.

Axillary lymph nodes are normal in appearance.

Interpretation: Fibrocystic parenchymal changes with multiple
enhancing foci and masses as described. These could be
fibroadenomata.

The right breast masses are morphologically benign in appearance,
however exhibit washout on dynamic imaging.

Targeted ultrasound is suggested of the RUOQ and left 3 \T\ 12
o'clock radii. If no ultrasound correlate is identified, MRI
guided vacuum assisted biopsy is suggested of the lesion in the
left 12 o'clock position and the lesion seen on the right image
70.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 48 year old female with new palpable lump in
the left retroareolar region. LMP 21 july 2010

COMPARISON: No previous MRI. Recent mammogram and ultrasound dated
22 July 2010.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images
(TE:3.7, TR:7.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast
were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2,
under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(8 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

FINDINGS: Both the breasts show mild amount of fibroglandular
tissue with mild background enhancement.

LEFT BREAST: There is a spiculated mass measuring 1.6cm (AP) x
1.7cm (superoinferior) x 1.6cm (transverse) noted in the upper
outer aspect of the left retroareolar region (anterior third image
14).
Immediately inferior to the above mass is another similar mass
measuring 1.1cm in diameter image 16.
The total superoinferior extent of the masses is 2.6cm.
Posterior to the lower mass is an area of linear non-mass like
enhancement images 13-14measuring 7cm (AP) x 1.8cm
(superoinferior) x 1.1cm (transverse). No involvement of the
pectoral muscle or chest wall noted.

RIGHT BREAST: shows a well-defined oval shaped mass in the middle
thirds of the 12 o'clock position measuring 6mm x 3mm in size
(image 67) showing plateau enhancement. No corresponding T2 bright
signal noted.
No other suspicious enhancement noted.

No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy noted.
IMPRESSION: MR findings reveal a likely malignant mass in the left
retroareolar region as described above.

We will call this patient back for ultrasound guided core biopsy
of the left retroareolar mass. At the same time an attempt will be
made to find a sonographic correlate to the right breast mass (at
12 o'clock location) for biopsy.
Spot compression views of the left breast will also be performed
to to evaluate the region corresponding to the non-mass like
enhancement. If this cant be correlated on the spot compression
views then MR guided biopsy would be indicated to confirm
multicentricity. Requisitions are required.

CLINICAL INDICATION: 54 yo , prior left mastectomy for phyllodes
tumor, for follow up of right breast focus of enhancement seen on
an outside MRI in June/08. LMP Nov/01/2008.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post

(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Prior outside MRI and US reports from June/08. No
prior MRI available for comparison.

FINDINGS:

Marked amount of fibroglandular tissue in the right breast with
marked stipple background parenchymal enhancement.
Post surgical changes noted on the left with areas of signal
voids. No suspicious abnormality noted in the left.
In the right, there are few scattered enhancing areas ranging in
size from 3-6mm as follows:
1.Enhancing focus (image 70), at 4 O'clock anterior third in the
lower inner quadrant , with high T2 signal demonstrating rapid
initial and progressive delayed type of enhancement. BI-RADS: 3.
Targeted US is recommended and if negative , six months MRI follow
up.
2.Enhancing focus (image 76) adjacent to the clip from prior
attempted biopsy at 3 o'clock position in the anterior third and
is superficial.It has non enhancing smooth septations and shows
rapid initial and plateau delayed type of enhancement. BI-RADS :
4. Targeted Ultrasound is recommended, and if negative , MRI
guided biopsy.
No definitive focal mass or other abnormal area of enhancement
seen.
3.enhancing irregular mass with spiculated margins (6mm), at right
upper outer quadrant at 10-11 oclock position (image 84),
demonstrating rapid initials and wash out delayed enhancement with
no corresponding T2 signal. BI-RADS: 5. Targeted US is recommended
and if negative MRI guided biopsy.
4. Enhancing focus (image 88) in the lower outer quadrant at 7
Oclock position with no T2 corresponding abnormality and is very
close to a vessel. This is most likely to represent a small lymph
node. BI-RADs: 2.
Multiple right axillary lymph nodes are noted in the right axilla
with the largest pathologically appearing one in the superior
axillary region inferior to the vessel measuring 1.8x0.7cm. No
size significant nodes left axillary lymph node.
IMPRESSION:
Marked fibroglandular tissue with stippled parenchymal
enhancement, as described.
Multiple right breast foci and a mass , as described. The patient
will be called back for targeted US of lesions (1-3) , as
described. MRI follow up for lesion number one and MRI guided
biopsies for lesions number two and three are recommended if no
visible abnormality on ultrasound.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Left spontaneous nipple discharge (greenish) 11
o'clock duct. Strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer.
LMP February 28 2010.

I note bilateral mammographic masses were shown to correspond to
multiple cysts.

Left 12 o'clock stereotactic core biopsy of 8 mm cluster of
calcifications shows at least ADH (performed March 1 2010).

I also note that on February 18 2010 the patient was booked for a
left galactogram however green discharge was noted from 8 ducts
(no blood or serous discharge) and thus the procedure was not
performed.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of breast tissue. There is
a marked degree and intensity of parenchymal enhancement in a
diffuse stippled distribution which markedly limits MRI
sensitivity. There are bilateral multiple scattered simple cysts.

There is a slightly larger and more focal area of non mass
enhancement in the left lateral breast middle third measuring 9 x
5 x 6 mm (image 11). This shows no associated T2 bright signal
and shows increasing enhancement over time, much like the
surrounding parenchymal tissue. There is no mammographic
correlate.

There is no other focal abnormal mass or enhancement in either
breast. In particular, there is no definite correlate to the left
12 o'clock calcifications.

There is no abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Background parenchymal enhancement markedly limits MRI
sensitivity. There is a single larger and more focal area in the
left lateral breast. While this likely represents an island of
parenchymal tissue, given the history, recommend confirmation with
MRI guided biopsy. Please submit a requisition for this to our
department.

2. No other MRI abnormality, and in particular no definite
correlate to the left 12 o'clock calcifications. As per the
biopsy report, surgical excision of these is recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Mammographic and sonographic medial right
breast nodule (probably benign). Additional left lateral breast
asymmetry with no sonographic correlate. MRI for problem solving.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76.1, TR:2500) fat saturated images, Sagittal VIBRANT without Fat
Saturation (TE: 4.2, TR: 7.2), pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3
mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of IV
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial
VIBRANT with gad and axial VIBRANT with Gad Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction
and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison with previous imaging. No prior MRI
available.

FINDINGS:

The breasts are predominantly fatty with minimal symmetric
stippled background enhancement some of which appears linear.

Corresponding to the right breast mammographic and sonographic
finding at approximately 3 o'clock, middle third (image 61), is a
circumscribed oval 0.4 cm mass with homogenous internal
enhancement, corresponding T2 and a central fatty hilum. This
shows rapid initial with plateau delayed enhancement, findings
typical of an intramammary lymph node.

In the superior left breast 12 o'clock axis, middle third (image
16), there is a 0.5 cm round mass with some spiculated margins
that shows rapid initial with plateau delayed enhancement. There
is no other suspicious signal or enhancement within either breast.

There is no lymphadenopathy.

IMPRESSION:

1. Right breast mammographic and sonographic finding corresponds
to a small intramammary lymph node. BI-RADS: 2

2. Indeterminate tiny left breast mass; this may correspond with
the previously described mammographic asymmetry, seen on the
routine CC view. Recommend MRI guided biopsy. A verbal report
will be given and an appointment facilitated. BI-RADS: 4

3. Bilateral symmetric stippled enhancement some of which appears
linear but remains favored as background parenchymal enhancement.
Recommend 6 month MRI follow-up.

CLINICAL INDICATION: For further evaluation of right breast
mammographic calcifications, radiologist recommended. Family
history of breast cancer.

LMP: September 4, 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammograms August, 2009 and MRIs April, 2009 and
May, 2007.

FINDINGS: The breasts are composed of mostly fibroglandular
tissue. There are innumerable fluctuating scattered cysts
diffusely throughout both breasts, some having increased in size
and others decreased. Some of the left breast cysts now
demonstrate concentric thin rim enhancement in keeping with
inflamed cysts. Moderate amount of moderate to marked intensity
diffuse, symmetric stippled background parenchymal enhancement
diffusely throughout both breasts, slightly decreased compared
with most recent prior but remains increased from initial study of
2007.

In the posterior central right breast there is a heterogeneous
focal enhancing area of non-mass enhancement with associated
distortion measuring 1 cm (images 67 - 69), demonstrating rapid
initial and areas of plateau and persistent delayed enhancement .
Internal tiny associated microcysts. This corresponds to the area
in question on recent mammography and is unchanged in retrospect
on prior MRIs dating back to 2007. The lesion enhances to a
lesser degree than much of the surrounding background parenchymal
enhancement.

Remainder of the examination is also unchanged.

OPINION: MRI correlate of an indeterminate appearing lesion
correlates to the abnormality identified on recent mammography.
This potentially represents a radial scar given stability dating
back to 2007 and the presence of marked fibrocystic changes
throughout both breasts, but remains indeterminate.

Recommendation was made for attempt at stereotactic biopsy. If
this is unsuccessful, an MRI guided biopsy would then be
recommended.

were obtained. TOTAL CONTRAST: 7 CC Gadovist

LMP: post menopausal

REFERENCE EXAM: mammograms and ultrasound August 2010.

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue with mild
degree of moderate intensity scattered background enhancement.

Corresponding to the suspicious mammographic/ultrasound mass at
the 8-9 o'clock position medial left breast, images 25-28, there
is an irregular enhancing mass 13 SI x 12 AP x 10 TV mm. This
shows rapid early enhancement with delayed washout enhancement ie
type III curve. No involvement skin or chest wall.

In the subareolar area there are some small areas of non mass
enhancement which may correspond to US findings. In addition at 12
o'clock anterior third breast, image 14, is a 5 mm focus showing
rapid initial and delayed washout.

The abnormal appearing left low axillary node seen on US is also
seen on the axial MR image 45 with no other abnormal appearing
nodes.

Just medial to the right nipple, at 3 o'clock, image 70, in the
anterior third of the breast there is a 5 mm focus of enhancement,
query parenchymal.

SUMMARY: highly suspicious mass medial left breast with suspicious
level I node and US biopsies recommended.

Areas of non mass enhancement left subareolar area may correspond
to US findings and US guided biopsy of most prominent area 5-6
o'clock recommended.

A focus of enhancement left breast at 12 o'clock, image 14, should
be re-evaluated on US. If no US finding then repeat assessment
with MRI in six months recommended. Similarly US assessment of the
focus in the right breast at 3 o'clock recommended and if no
correlate MRI follow up in six months recommended.

On the same day but prior to these biopsies the galactogram should
be attempted again as this may be helpful in showing extent of
disease.

These procedures will be facilitated once we have the appropriate
requisitions for left ductogram, US core biopsies (at least 2
sites) left breast, FNAB left axilla as well US assessment right
breast with possible biopsy.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 72 years old, increasing right lateral
breast asymmetry suspicious for malignancy. Had FNA at an outside
institution, pathology is suggestive of angiolipoma. Questionable
angiosarcoma. Menopausal.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No prior MRI available for comparison. Two views
of right breast outside mammogram are only available.

FINDINGS:
There is scattered amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild
degree and intensity of multiregional background parenchymal
enhancement.
In the right lateral lower breast, there are susceptibility
artifacts most likely related to previous biopsy. Within this
area,there is large heterogenous segmental non mass enhancement
extending to the nipple. This measures approximately 7.4 AP x 3 CC
x 1.4 TV cm. There is also extension of this medially at
approximately 5 O'clock position. The overall parenchymal
involvement spans from 7 to 12 O'clock position.
In image 79 and 80, there are two small oval shaped enhancing
masses with probably non enhancing septation measuring 5 and 7 mm
respectively. These could represent intra mammary lymph nodes or
fibroadenomas.
No suspicious focal mass, signal or enhancement in the left
breast.
Slightly prominent right axillary lymph nodes with abnormal
morphology, largest measuring 9 mm (AP dimension, image 87 axial).

OPINION:
Right lateral breast vague large heterogeneous segmental non mass
enhancement. Ultrasound correlation is recommended with view of
biopsy.
Slightly prominent right axillary nodes. Although not significant
by size criteria, the morphology is concerning. Ultrasound
evaluation is recommended with view of ultrasound guided fine

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Patient with left nipple discharge

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Left breast ultrasound of 08/19/2008

FINDINGS:

There are scattered fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. No
significant background of parenchymal enhancement.

No MRI correlate to the intraductal mass seen on ultrasound in the
subareolar region. The apart from some benign intramammary lymph
node. No significant abnormality left breast.

In the right breast, (image 82) in the lower outer quadrant
between 7 and 8 o'clock position, middle third of the breast is an
area of known mass enhancement which is somewhat linear. It
measures approximately 3.5 cm in length. This shows continuous
enhancement pattern. It is slightly hyperintense on T2. It is
most likely parenchymal.

No suspicious enhancement in either breast.
IMPRESSION:

No abnormal enhancement left breast to correspond to the
intraductal mass seen on ultrasound. A papillary lesion is still
to be excluded in this patient with nipple discharge.
Consideration should be given to excisional biopsy after
preoperative wire localization if clinically indicated. (BI-RADS
1)

Non-mass enhancement right breast possibly parenchymal for which
follow-up MRI suggested in 6 months. (BI-RADS 3)

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Recent stereotactic biopsy of left breast
upper outer quadrant microcalcifications, atypical ductal
hyperplasia on pathology.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained. Kinetic curve analysis was performed.

LMP: September 4, 2010.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammograms same date.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally.
No significant background parenchymal enhancement.

LEFT BREAST: In the posterior upper outer quadrant (images 12 and
13) there is a 6 mm spiculated mass likely corresponding to the
concerning and recently biopsied cluster at microcalcifications on
mammography. The tiny mass demonstrates a marked degree of rapid
initial and plateau delayed enhancement. The biopsy tract is seen
leading up to the lesion on the axial images.

RIGHT BREAST: 2 minimally enhancing foci of enhancement in the
central breast measuring 3 and 4 mm (image 60 and 59) are likely
benign.

No abnormal lymph nodes.

OPINION: Tiny spiculated mass posterior upper outer quadrant left
breast corresponds to the lesion recently biopsied with a
diagnosis of ADH. Surgical excision biopsy recommended. (BI-RADS
4)

2 probably benign minimally enhancing foci in the right breast,
suspected as fibroadenomas. Follow-up MRI in 6 months
recommended. (BI-RADS: 3)

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: History of bilateral lumpectomies (11
previous excisional biopsies for benign disease). Recent core
biopsy on the left demonstrated ADH. The patient is at high risk
for breast cancer and is considering prophylactic mastectomies
(mother (age 38), maternal aunts).

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison is made to prior imaging. There have
been no prior MRIs.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate amount of breast tissue showing a moderate
degree and marked intensity of stippled enhancement. This limits
evaluation.

In the left breast at the 3 o'clock position there is a 19.2 x 8.4
x 8.0 mm mass (image 13) which demonstrates progressive
enhancement. This would correlate with the lobulated isoechoic
mass identified on the recent ultrasound. A second, small mass is
identified just superior to this (image 12) which measures a
approximately 7 mm in greatest dimension and shows early
progressive enhancement with plateau. A third area of masslike
enhancement is identified on image 17 which measures 6.3 mm in
greatest dimension and shows rapid enhancement with progressive
delayed phase. Each of these are iso or mildly hyperintense on
T2 weighted imaging. There are scattered T2 isointense masses in
the left breast which demonstrate mild progressive, peripheral,
enhancement. No other masses or areas of abnormal enhancement are
identified in the left breast. There is no abnormal enhancement
that would correlate with the linear calcifications in the LUOQ
seen on prior mammography.

In the right breast, there is a small mass, measuring 5.6 mm
(image 67) which shows rapid enhancement which persists. No other
masses or areas of abnormal enhancement are identified in the
right breast.

There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.


OPINION: There is no definite evidence of malignancy. Most of the
masses described likely represent small fibroadenomas or
intramammary lymph nodes as they all have benign features. A 6
month follow-up MRI is suggested if prophylactic mastectomy not
performed as stated in the clinical history provided.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Right blood nipple discharge with resultant resection
of a right nipple adenoma with atypical ductal hyperplasia
incompletely excised. Rule out residual disease. History of
previous right benign surgical biopsy and bilateral
sonographically seen breast masses. LMP March 9 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to previous imaging.

FINDINGS: Large amount of breast tissue in both breasts with
moderate degree and intensity of background enhancement. This,
along with the bilateral breast masses and cysts, reduces the
sensitivity of MRI.

Right post operative change. Linear non mass enhancement directly
deep to the nipple, 2.0 cm long with no T2 bright signal (image
67). Posterior 12 o'clock non mass enhancement increasing with
time and with no T2 bright signal, 1.2 x 1.1 cm (image 65);
possibly parenchyma.

Bilateral breast masses are seen, all with mild heterogeneous
enhancing which increased over time. Some have mild associated T2
bright signal while others do not. These likely correspond to the
sonographically seen masses although direct comparison is
difficult due to altered positioning of the breast. Ultimately,
the masses are better seen and followed by ultrasound.

Right masses:
- 10 o'clock 3 cm from nipple - 14 x 12 mm (image 63), no T2
signal
- 9 o'clock 5 cm from nipple - 6 x 5 mm (image 63), mild T2 signal
- 11 o'clock 5 cm from nipple - 8 x 9 mm (image 62), no T2 signal
- 1 o'clock 4 cm from nipple - 22 x 14 mm (image 70), mild T2
signal

Left masses:
- 8 o'clock 2 cm from nipple - 13 x 12 mm (image 11), mild T2
signal
- 11 o'clock 4 cm from nipple - 9 x 7 mm (image 20), no T2 signal
- 3 o'clock 3 cm from nipple - 15 x 8 mm (image 8), no T2 signal

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.

OPINION: Background enhancement limits MRI sensitivity.

1. Right subareolar non mass linear enhancement, indeterminate.
Recommend targeted right breast ultrasound (and biopsy); if not
seen by ultrasound, recommend MRI guided biopsy. Please submit a
requisition for this to our department.

2. Right superior posterior non mass enhancement, possibly
parenchymal. Recommend targeted right breast ultrasound; if not
seen by ultrasound, recommend 6 month MRI follow up.

3. Bilateral breast masses. These are better seen and followed
by ultrasound. Recommend follow up as per the previous ultrasound
report (targeted bilateral ultrasound of some masses in 6 months).

4. Next bilateral mammogram is due in December 2009.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

HISTORY: Possible locally advanced cancer, with suspicious area
in lower breast. For disease extent. Apparently there is an
outside FNA of a 3:30 lesion that is positive for malignancy.

Comparison was made with previous imaging.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequence MRI images of both breasts
were obtained without and with IV gadolinium contrast.

FINDINGS: In the left breast there is a large confluent area of
abnormal enhancement in a regional distribution. This extends
from approximately 2 o'clock to 7 o'clock. The exact dimensions
are difficult to assess, this measures roughly 9.6 cm deep x 2.8
cm cranial-caudal x 6.6 cm transverse. This extends far
posteriorly to the chest wall however invasion into the chest wall
is not demonstrated. This extends anteriorly to the nipple (best
demonstrated on image 20). The enhancement shows slight washout
with time. Within this bulk of enhancement there are two more
focal areas of enhancement at the 3:30 o'clock position far
posterior (image 12) measuring 2.0 x 1.9 cm, and at the 6 o'clock
position middle third (image 20) measuring 2.5 x 1.5 cm.

Two other foci of abnormal enhancement are seen in the upper outer
quadrant including a 1.0 x 0.8 cm mass in the 2 o'clock position
far posterior (image 12), approximately 1.2 cm superior to the
bulk of enhancement, and a 1.1 x 0.6 cm mass in the 1 o'clock
position (image 13), approximately 3.1 cm superior to the bulk of
enhancement.

In the upper inner quadrant there are two small areas of
enhancement (image 29) - one more anterior measuring 7 mm and one
more posterior measuring 5 mm. These show steadily increasing
enhancement with time and are indeterminate.

There are a few small foci of scattered parenchymal type
enhancement in the right breast (including images 72, 77, 83 and
88).

There are numerous small simple T2 bright cysts scattered
throughout both breasts. The largest in the right is in the upper
outer quadrant and measures 1.5 x 1.1 cmm the largest in the left
is in the lateral anterior breast and measures 2.4 x 1.7 cm.

There are a few prominent lymph nodes in the left axilla, the
largest in the low axilla measures 1.2 cm.

IMPRESSION: Large area of abnormal enhancement in the left breast
extending from approximately 2 to 7 o'clock. Four smaller foci of
indeterminate but suspicious enhancement are seen in the upper
outer and upper inner quadrants. This is suspicious for DCIS with
foci of invasion. Repeat left whole breast ultrasound at our
institution is suggested with ultrasound guided core biopsy of at
least one abnormal sonographic area (preferably in different
quadrants). As recommended in the consultation report, repeat
left breast magnification views at our institution are also
recommended.

Bulky left axillary lymph nodes. Left axillary ultrasound is
recommended, with fine needle aspiration of the suspicious lymph
node.

A few small foci of parenchymal type enhancement are seen in the
right breast. Right breast ultrasound is recommended as a second
look. If the findings are unremarkable, repeat MRI in 6 months
time is suggested to ensure stability.

A verbal report will be sent and an appointment(s) will be
facilitated.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Left calcifications, for biopsy. Extent of disease.
Postmenopausal.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging. There is also a CD
containing a bilateral mammogram dated 10/27/2009 and a left
breast magnification views and left breast ultrasound dated
11/11/2009, from Toronto Center for Medical Imaging.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of breast tissue with a mild degree and
intensity of enhancement.

Linear non mass enhancement in the left breast 6 o'clock middle
third breast corresponds to the mammographic calcifications, and
measures 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.7 cm, lying 4.4 cm from the nipple (image
17).

There are 3 other small foci of enhancement in the left lower
outer quadrant including one just posterior to the nipple (images
15 and 17). In relation to the 6 o'clock enhancement, these lie
up to 4.4 cm anterior, 2.1 cm superior, and 0.7 cm lateral. The
more lateral one likely corresponds to the additional cluster of
mammographic calcifications. Other two areas not definitely
correlated on mammography.

Small focal area of non mass enhancement in the right anterior
lateral breast has corresponding high T2 signal. This measures 7
mm (image 64). This is not correlated on the outside right
mammogram dated October 2009.

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Left 6 o'clock enhancement corresponding to the mammographic
calcifications. Stereotactic core biopsy recommended.

2. Left lower outer enhancing non mass enhancement, in small
foci. One lies just posterior to the nipple. One likely
corresponds to the additional cluster of mammographic
calcifications. Stereotactic core biopsy of the additional
cluster of calcifications is recommended. If this is not
technically possible (ie cannot be seen), then MRI guided biopsy
of one of these clusters is recommended. Also suggest left breast
ultrasound (and axilla).

3. Right anterior lateral small enhancing focus which has T2
bright signal. This could be a tiny fibroadenoma. Suggest
targeted second look ultrasound. If not seen, recommend 6 month
MRI follow up.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Kmown malignancy RUOQ - for extent of disease \T\ nodal assessment Post menopausal

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted  3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:8.6) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:7.8) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast (5 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammograms of 2011

FINDINGS: The breasts have a large amount of fibroglandular tissue with minimal background parenchymal enhancement.  There are several small complicated cysts bilaterally.  No suspicious finding in the left breast.

On the right there is a large dominant heterogeneously rim enhancing mass in the upper posterior central breast slightly laterally measuring approximately 3.3 cm in diameter.  There are multiple, at least 7 satellite nodules which are both superior
and inferior to the dominant mass.  There is an 8 mm nodule in image 53 superior to the dominant mass.  There are multiple masses inferiorly and posteriorly.  The extent of disease is 8 cm in SI dimension 5.7 centimeters in the AP and 3 cm in the
transverse.  Extending between the more posterior and anterior masses inferiorly there is a linear non-mass enhancement.  No involvement of the pectoralis muscle or skin is seen.  There is a large abnormal right internal mammary node with a large
abnormal interpectoral node and abnormal axillary nodes.  Incidentally noted on the axial projection are multiple hypointense masses in the liver measuring up to 6.5 cm in diameter, possibly cystic.

OPINION: Known malignancy in the right breast has multiple satellite masses together measuring up to 8 cm in extent with metastatic disease to axillary, internal mammary and interpectoral nodes.  Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of the dominant
mass for receptors as well as fine needle aspiration of an abnormal lymph node have been requested.

Further evaluation of the lesions in the liver with ultrasound is suggested.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Biopsy proven left breast invasive cancer
with focal in situ component (prior work-up done at an outside
institution). Pre-operative MRI to determine extent of disease.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76.1, TR:2500) fat saturated images, Sagittal VIBRANT without Fat
Saturation (TE: 4.2, TR: 7.2), pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3
mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of IV
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial
VIBRANT with gad and axial VIBRANT with Gad Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction
and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No prior imaging available at this institution.

FINDINGS:

BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM:

The breasts are extremely dense. This can obscure mammographic
masses. A BB marks the site of the palpable finding left breast
(biopsy proven cancer). Corresponding to the palpable
abnormality, in the central left breast, best seen on the MLO and
compression magnification ML views, there is an obscured mass with
spiculated margins causing surrounding architectural distortion
with approximate dimensions of 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm. No obvious
associated calcifications.

There are punctate calcifications in the upper outer left breast
(approximately 3 o'clock, 10 cm from the nipple) which are favored
benign.

No concerning abnormality noted in the right breast.

BILATERAL MRI:

The patient is week 3 of the menstrual cycle.

There is a large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally with
mild degree of moderate intensity enhancement.

Corresponding to the known malignancy (image 10), there is a 3.9 x
2.9 x 1.9 cm irregular mass with spiculated margins and
heterogeneous internal enhancement in the inferior lateral left
breast, middle to posterior thirds with extension into the
anterior breast. The mass extends medially to the nipple line.
There is no corresponding high T2 signal and it exhibits rapid
initial with plateau delayed enhancement. There are several
satellite nodules surrounding this dominant mass with similar MRI
characteristics. Overall dimensions of tumor involvement
including satellite lesions is 3.9 (SI) x 4.7 (AP) x 1.9 cm.
Adjacent to the dominant mass in the central breast (image 16),
there is segmental clumped non-mass enhancement measuring 2.8 cm also suspicious for disease.

In the superior medial left breast (image 20), there are two
discrete masses each measuring 0.7 cm which are concerning for
satellite lesions. There is no obvious invasion of the pectoralis
muscle or chest wall.

There is focal non-mass enhancement in the medial right breast
measuring 1.2 x 0.8 cm. This is favored parenchymal. There is no
other suspicious signal or enhancement within the right breast.

There is a prominent left axillary lymph node measuring
approximately 0.7 cm. Although, this is not enlarged by size
criteria it appears larger when compared with the other nodes.
There are small bilateral internal mammary lymph nodes of
questionable clinical significance.

IMPRESSION:

1. Locally advanced left breast cancer with an overall
infiltrating nodular pattern (type 2). Suspicion for multifocal
involvement in the superior medial left breast. Recommend
second-look targeted ultrasound. If clinically appropriate biopsy
of any additional findings can be arranged. BI-RADS: 6

2. Prominent left axillary lymph node. Recommend ultrasound left
axilla with view to FNA. BI-RADS: 4

3. Small bilateral internal mammary lymph nodes of questionable
significance. These can be reassessed at the time of follow-up
MRIs.

4. Focal areas of non-mass enhancement in the medial right breast
are favored parenchymal. The medial right breast can be evaluated
at the time of the second look targeted ultrasound. If there is
no sonographic correlate, then follow-up at post neoadjuvant
treatment MRI recommended. BI-RADS: 3

A verbal report will be given and an appointment for the
additional imaging facilitated.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging, including outside imaging from
Quantum Medical Imaging Services. EPR report describes an MRI
performed recently at Scarborough General Hospital however we do
not have the report or images.

FINDINGS: There is a large amount of breast tissue with a
moderate degree and marked intensity of enhancement; this limits
MRI sensitivity. Bilateral small multiple cysts.

Right upper outer posterior spiculated and lobulated enhancing
mass with washout of enhancement and with no chest wall invasion,
measuring 3.0 cm TV x 3.4 cm AP x 3.0 cm CC (3.9 cm from the
nipple).

Right lower inner posterior focal non mass enhancement measuring 8
x 7 mm (image 61); this is likely parenchymal.

Left upper inner posterior lobulated and angulated mass with mild
and plateauing enhancement. There are several surrounding
adjacent nodules with similar morphology and enhancement.
Altogether this measures 5.8 cm CC x 3.4 cm AP x 2.6 cm TV (the
dominant mass measures 5.0 x 2.1 x 2.6 cm, image 19).

Left lower inner posterior 2 small enhancing masses measuring 6
and 5 mm (image 17); these could be parenchymal.

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.

Multiple low signal liver lesions which are well defined and likely cysts.

IMPRESSION:

1. Background marked parenchymal enhancement limits MRI
sensitivity. Recommend bilateral whole breast ultrasound for
further evaluation.

2. Right upper outer mass, apparently this has already been
biopsied as invasive ductal cancer (if repeat biopsy is required,
please submit a requisition for this).

3. Right lower inner non mass enhancement which is likely
parenchymal. Recommend second look ultrasound. If not seen,
recommend 6 month follow up MRI.

3. Left upper inner mass, apparently this has already been
biopsied as LCIS. If this is the case, this is discordant. This
was seen on outside ultrasound and thus repeat ultrasound guided
core biopsy is recommended if previous biopsy did indeed show LCIS
(if so, please submit a requisition for this).

4. Left lower inner 2 masses which are indeterminate and possibly
parenchymal. Recommend second look ultrasound. If breast
conserving surgery is being contemplated, biopsy is recommended
(using ultrasound guidance if seen by ultrasound, or using MRI
guidance if not seen by ultrasound).

5. Liver lesions which are possibly cysts, recommend ultrasound
characterization.

CLINICAL INDICATION: 46 year old with dense breast. Left breast
mass, biopsied at an outside institution with a diagnosis of
fibroepithelial lesion. Repeat biopsy at this institution with a
diagnosis of ALH and LCIS.

LMP: Prior hysterectomy.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1

dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram and US of October 1, 2009. US guided
biopsy of same date.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate amount of breast tissue showing a mild degree
of moderately intense enhancement. Innumerable cysts diffusely
throughout both breasts.

In the anterior 1/3 of the LOQ of the left breast (Image 17) there
is a mass like area of enahancement that measures 1.5 x 2.0 x 1.5
cm which would correlate with the mass biopsied under US guidance.
This mass has a lobulated shape and a smooth margin,
heterogeneous internal enhancement and shows marked enhancement
with a rapid upstroke and persistent delayed enhancement. Mass
is isointense on T2.

A second mass is identified in the left breast (Image 19) which
measures 8 mm and is irregular in shape with a small spicule. It
is located in the retroareolar region and shows a marked degree of
enhancement with a rapid upstroke of enhancement with a plateau
delayed phase. Mass is isointense on T2.

A focal area of asymmetric non-mass like enhancement is present in
the posterior UIQ of the left breast (Images 20-24) with an
enahancement pattern similar to background parenchyma, favored as
parenchymal.

In the UIQ of the right breast there is a mass like area of
enhancment which is reniform in shape with a smooth margin and
most likely represents a mildly prominent intramammary lymph node.

There is an asymmetric, regional area of clumped, non-mass like
enhancement in the LIQ of the right breast. This covers an area
of 5.2 x 3.3 x 7.0 cm involving the anterior, mid and extending
into the posterior portion of the breast. There is extension into
the subareolar region without extension to the pectoralis muscle.
There is marked enhancement with a brisk upstroke of and a plateau
in the delayed phase.

No abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

1. Enhancing mass in LOQ of the left breast, indeterminate in
appearance correlates with area biopsied on ultrasound, LCIS and
ALH on pathology. BI-RADS 4.

2. Second mass like area of enhancement in left breast.
Recommend second look US +/- biopsy and MR guided biopsy if US is
negative. BI-RADS 4.

3. Focal area of non-mass like enhancement in the UIQ of the left
breast likely assymetric parenchymal tissue. Recommend targeted
ultrasound and if sonographically occult 6 month follow-up MRI.
BI-RADS 3.

4. Regional, clumped area of non-mass like enhancement in the LIQ
of the right breast. Recommend second look ultrasound +/- biopsy.
MR guided biopsy if US is negative. BI-RADS 4.

5. Recommend ultrasound evaluation of the right axilla and
evaluation of probable upper outer quadrant intramammary lymph
node.

6. If MR guided biopsies are indicated then they will have to be
booked separately given the location of the lesions in the
breasts.

A verbal report will be called to referring clinicians office and
an appointment will be facilitated upon receipt of the
requisitions.

FINDINGS: Hysterectomy.
Large amount of fibroglandular tissue is noted bilaterally. There
is mild degree of moderate intensity stippled pattern background
enhancement .
Left breast: In the upper outer quadrant posteriorly, image 21,
there is evidence of a rapidly enhancing 5 mm mass with plateauing
in the delayed phase.
Right breast: No suspicious enhancement is noted.

No adenopathy.
IMPRESSION: Indeterminate rapidly enhancing mass in the left upper
outer quadrant.
US evaluation is recommended. If no sonographic correlate, MR
guided biopsy is then recommended.
We will facilitate the appointment.

Due for routine bilateral Mammograms in July 2009.
For optimal care, Mammograms and MR are preferably done at the
same institution.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Known left locally advanced breast cancer.
LMP August 14/09

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
80, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted (TE:4.2,
TR:7.4) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat
saturated images (TE:3.6, TR:7.2) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
Multiphase (108, 3 mm slices, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1
mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast( 6 cc) was administered by
injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant with GD Swap
(TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram of August 14/09

FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense with a mild amount
and intensity background parenchymal enhancement. The known
malignancy is seen predominately in the left upper inner quadrant
but extends lateral to the nipple line. It measures approximately
6 cm in the SI dimension, 7.6 cm in the AP dimension and 3.5 cm in
the transverse dimension. It extends to the immediate subareolar
region although no abnormal nipple enhancement is seen. No
involvement of the pectoralis muscle is evident. No definitely
abnormal left axillary nodes are present.

On the right superior and lateral to the nipple line image 65
there is a focal area of linear non-mass enhancement showing a
rapid early and delayed plateau pattern measuring 1.6 cm in
length.
IMPRESSION: Large locally advanced left breast cancer. Axillary
nodes would be better evaluated with ultrasound. A requisition
should be sent. BI-RADS 6

Indeterminate non-mass enhancement in the right upper outer
quadrant is unlikely to the seen on ultrasound. Magnification
views of the area are recommended. If suspicious calcifications
are not identified an MRI guided vacuum assisted biopsy would be
recommended in this clinical setting. BI-RADS: 4

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram 6/9/2009

FINDINGS:

Large volume severe, amount and intensity diffuse stippled
background enhancement limiting sensitivity.

In the left central subareolar breast, image 19, middle third,
there is a 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm mass with rapid initial in plateau
delayed and delayed plateau enhancement, with T2 signal greater
than adjacent background parenchyma. There are some areas of dark
T2 signal within, corresponding with areas of non enhancement
within the lesion. This is a possible fibroadenoma. Similarly on
image 14, superior and medial to the above lesion, there is a
lobulated mass with similar enhancement and T2 characteristics.
No corresponding mammographic findings, however breast density
limits mammographic correlation.

No concerning enhancement in the right breast.

0.2cm left internal mammary node, likely incidental. No
significant adenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

No MR evidence of malignancy in the right breast.

Large degree background enhancement limits sensitivity of this
MRI. Left subareolar mass (image 19), left upper inner mass,
possible fibroadenomas. This should be correlated with
ultrasound. If not seen sonographically suggest 6 month follow up
MRI. BIRADS 3.

administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: No prior MRI available for comparison. Mammograms
from May/21/2009 are available.

FINDINGS:
There is moderate left and marked right fibroglandular tissue.
Mild left and moderate right degree and intensity stippled
background parenchymal enhancement.
Post surgical changes in the left lower outer quadrant with skin
edema, thickening and post operative seroma measuring 3.9 AP x 2.7
CC x 2.3 TV cm. Anterior and superior to the surgical cavity
(images 11 and 13), there are two areas of linear non mass
enhancement which are indetermined.
No suspicious focal signal or enhancement in the right breast.
Enhancing lesion in the lower sternum (image 40 sagittal images,
51 axial) with no corresponding fat signal on the non fat sat
images T1 WI .
No axillary adenopathy.
Note is made of few ( at least three) low intensity liver lesions.

OPINION:
Left breast post surgical changes and seroma. Indeterminate linear
enhancement anterior and superior to the surgical cavity, could
represent post surgical enhancement vs residual disease. MRI
guided biopsies of both areas recommended. Please submit a
requisition for this to our department and the appointment will be
facilitated.
Lower sternal enhancing lesion, non specific. Further evaluation
with bone scan is suggested as clinically indicated.
Liver low intensity lesions. Further evaluation with a liver
ultrasound is recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Baseline mammogram and subsequent ultrasound showed
left calcifications and masses. LMP September 5 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: There is a large amount of breast tissue with a marked
degree and moderate intensity of enhancement; this limits MRI
sensitivity.

Left central (slightly lateral) posterior spiculated mass with
delayed washout of contrast and associated distortion of breast
tissue, measuring 13 x 12 x 7 mm (image 22, 6.6 cm from the
nipple). Lying 1.0 cm lateral to this is a smaller vague
spiculated mass measuring 6 x 5 x 6 mm (image 17, 6.5 cm from the
nipple). These are likely the 2 masses seen sonographically.

In the posterior third of the left breast there is a third small
vague spiculated enhancing mass, measuring 6 mm and lying 3.9 cm
posterior and superior to the dominant mass (image 22).

No abnormal enhancement to correlate to the mammographic
calcifications.

No abnormal mass or enhancement in the right breast.

No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. MRI sensitivity is limited by parenchymal enhancement.

2. Left upper outer breast contains one definite and two probable
masses, two of which were seen on ultrasound. Recommend second
look ultrasound to demonstrate the third mass.

3. As stated previously, ultrasound guided biopsy of the largest
left breast mass and stereotactic core biopsy of 2 clusters of
left calcifications, and ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration
of a left axillary lymph node are all recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: 44 years-old female . Evaluate extent of
disease. Abnormal mammogram and ultrasound.

LMP: September 24, 2009 . Day 5 .

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Previous breast imaging including bilateral
mammogram and left breast and axillary ultrasound on September 23,
2009 .

FINDINGS:
There is a large amount of fibroglandular breast tissue.
High degree of moderate intensity background parenchymal
enhancement. The MRI was performed on day 5 of the menstrual
cycle. That significantly reduce the sensitivity of the MRI.

Significant motion artefacts that decrease the sensitivity of the
contrast enhanced and subtracted series (the patient has sneezed
x3 after contrast injection).


Bilateral subcentimetric simple cysts and ectatic ducts containing
proteinaceous material.

Left-
Large area of marked clustered ring-like non-masslike regional
enhancement occupying most of the left upper outer quadrant. This
area involve the immediate subareolar region up to the posterior
third of the breast, measuring at least 11.5 x 6.7 x 3.8 cm .
This is suspicious for infiltrative disease. No definite evidence
of nipple or chest wall invasion.

The ultrasound described suspicious masses are difficult to see
through this regional a non-masslike enhancement due to a similar
degree of enhancement. The 12 o'clock mass at 3 cm from the
nipple, corresponds to an area of parenchymal distortion and an
enhancing mass measuring 2 .6 x 1 .8 0 .9 cm (image 19). There is
no definite MRI correlate for the ultrasound finding in the 2
o'clock position at 8cm from the nipple.

In the medial subareolar area (image 24), the previously described
palpable mass corresponds to a 13.5 x 10.5 x 10.0 mm progressively
enhancing mass, with corresponding bright T2 signal and internal
dark unenhancing septations. These MRI characteristics are
suggestive of a fibroadenoma.

Right-
Due to the high amount of background enhancement, the right breast
is difficult to accurately assess. Multiple foci of heterogenous
enhancement are seen and this is probably physiologic and due to
the improper timing of the MRI. However, there is no area of
enhancement as avid as in the contralateral breast.

In the left axilla, there is two lymph nodes with thicken cortex.
One 3mm left internal mammary node is also seen.

OPINION:
1. High amount of background enhancement and significant motion
artifacts are reducing the sensitivity of the exam.
2. Regional non-masslike enhancement involving all the left upper
outer quadrant, with associated mass, corresponding to the
sonographic finding. Highly suspicious calcifications are found in
this area and a stereotactic guided core biopsy is suggested. The
ultrasound mass in the 12 o'clock position can also be biopsied
under ultrasound guidance. BI-RADS 5
3. Palpable probably benign mass in the left medial subareolar
region, most likely to represent a fibroadenoma. Depending of the
surgical approach a 6 months ultrasound can be performed. Bi-RADS
3
4. Two abnormal left axillary lymph nodes. FNA under ultrasound
guidance of one of them is suggested as per previous report.
5. Multiple foci of heterogenous enhancement are seen in the
right breast and this is probably physiologic and due to the
suboptimal timing of the MRI relating to the menstrual cycle.
However, no definite area suspicious for malignant disease on the
right side. A 6 months follow-up breast MRI properly timed to week
2 of the menstrual cycle recommended. BI-RADS: 3

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Strong family history of breast cancer; 25%
lifetime risk of breast cancer. New palpable nodule right upper
outer breast.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76.1, TR:2500) fat saturated images, Sagittal VIBRANT without Fat
Saturation (TE: 4.2, TR: 7.2), pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3
mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of IV
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial
VIBRANT with gad and axial VIBRANT with Gad Swap (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction
and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison with previous imaging.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with moderate
degree of mild to moderate intensity heterogeneous background
parenchymal enhancement. This limits MRI sensitivity.

There are bilateral breast cysts.

Within the superior medial right breast, middle third (image 71),
there is a lobulated mass with smooth margins and no corresponding
T2 signal measuring 0.5 cm. It demonstrates rapid initial with
plateau delayed enhancement. There is a second 0.7 cm mass with
ill-defined margins and no corresponding T2 in the superior medial
right breast anteriorly (image 63). No other suspicious signal or
enhancement is noted in the right breast.

There is no abnormal signal or enhancement in the left breast.

There is no lymphadenopathy.

IMPRESSION:

1. Two enhancing masses in the superior medial right breast are
probably benign. Recommend second-look targeted ultrasound. If
there is no sonographic correlate, then recommend six month
follow-up MRI timed to the second week of the menstrual cycle.

2. No MRI evidence of malignancy in the left breast.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Known right DCIS LMP Aug 18/10

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.6) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images
(TE:3.7, TR:7.8) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast
were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2,
under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(6.5 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram of Sept 2010.

FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense with a mild amount
of moderate intensity stippled background parenchymal enhancement.
There are small cysts bilaterally. No suspicious enhancement is
seen in the left breast.

On the right there is a large segmental area of non-mass
enhancement (images 70 - 79) corresponding to the area of
microcalcifications seen on the mammogram. This area contains
small cysts with high T2 and T1 precontrast signal suggesting the
presence of fluid and either proteinaceous material or blood.
This area measures at least 8 cm in AP dimension, 6 cm in the SI
and 3 cm in the transverse. In addition there is a separate 9 mm
focal area in the RUIQ posteriorly
image 65 showing rapid early and delayed plateau enhancement.
This is at least 1.5 cm medially to the large area of enhancement.

No involvement of chest wall or skin is evident. No obviously
abnormal axillary nodes are seen but there is a right axillary
node with an eccentrically thickened cortex.

OPINION: Suspicious MRI findings in the area of the known
malignancy corresponding to the suspicious microcalcifications
seen on mammography. In addition there is a focal area in the
right upper inner quadrant which is of concern. If breast
conservation surgery is being contemplated, further investigation
of this area with mammographic views and ultrasound and possible
biopsy would be suggested. If no mammographic or ultrasound
correlate is found then an MRI guided biopsy would be suggested.
Ultrasound evaluation of the right axillary nodes is also
suggested. Requisitions would need to be sent to the Department
before these will be be arranged.

REFERENCE EXAM: Outside imaging of 2008. 2009 and CD could not
be opened

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. At 6
o'clock left breast but, there is an area of non-mass enhancement
measuring 20 x 16 by 6 mm. This is located in the anterior third
of the left breast at 6 o'clock. It shows rapid initial
enhancement with plateau and some areas of washout. No other
suspicious areas seen in the left breast.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

Suspicious linear clumped enhancement left breast at 6 o'clock. I
suggest repeating the mammogram with magnification views of the
microcalcifications seen on the mammogram and to correlate with
the MRI. If it is the same area of microcalcifications, the
biopsy can be done under stereotactic guidance. Otherwise a , MRI
guided biopsy should be done and appropriate requisition should be
sent.

INDICATION: Left breast lesion, assess for other abnormalities.
LMP 4 weeks ago.

Family history breast cancer, including 2 males. Prior superior
left surgical biopsy related to palpable finding. Subsequent
mammogram in September 2010 showed a superior 11 mm possible mass.
Ultrasound of August 2010 showed this to correspond to an 11
o'clock mass that is identical to the mass biopsied elsewhere in
January 2010 as a fibroadenoma.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount breast tissue with moderate degree and
marked intensity of enhancement; this limits MRI sensitivity.

Left post operative change.

Left breast 12 o'clock middle third contains a lobulated and
slightly irregular mass with mild T2 bright signal and increasing
enhancement over time located superior and medial to the surgical
scar. This measures 12 x 8 mm (image 19) and likely corresponds
to the sonographic mass. There is an area of vague non mass
enhancement, enhancement increasing over time, located inferior to
this at the surgical site (image 19). This may be parenchymal or
post operative change.

Left breast contains several small areas of focal non mass
enhancement with no T2 bright signal, all nonspecific and possibly
parenchymal:
- upper outer linear middle third - 10 x 6 mm (image 10)
- 12 o'clock anterior - 11 x 9 mm (image 15)

Right breast contains several small areas of focal non mass
enhancement with irregular margins and no T2 bright signal, all
nonspecific and possibly parenchymal:
- upper inner middle third - 7 mm (image 64)
- 6 o'clock middle third - 5 mm (image 71)
- upper outer posterior - 5 mm (image 73)
- lower outer linear middle third - 10 x 3 mm (image 76).

No significant lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: Background parenchymal enhancement limits MRI
sensitivity.

1. Left 12 o'clock mass corresponds to the sonographic mass. On
ultrasound this is felt to be unchanged from a January 2010
ultrasound (biopsy showed fibroadenoma). Suggest further
ultrasound follow up in 6 months (or follow up at the time of the
next MRI).

2. Left 12 o'clock adjacent non mass enhancement is probably
either post operative change or parenchymal. Suggest 6 month
follow up MRI.

3. Bilateral small focal areas of non mass enhancement are
probably parenchymal however recommended targeted second look
ultrasound, and if not seen, then follow up MRI in 6 months.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Left breast lesion, assess for other abnormalities.
LMP 4 weeks ago.

Family history breast cancer, including 2 males. Prior superior
left surgical biopsy related to palpable finding. Subsequent
mammogram in September 2010 showed a superior 11 mm possible mass.
Ultrasound of August 2010 showed this to correspond to an 11
o'clock mass that is identical to the mass biopsied elsewhere in
January 2010 as a fibroadenoma.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount breast tissue with moderate degree and
marked intensity of enhancement; this limits MRI sensitivity.

Left post operative change.

Left breast 12 o'clock middle third contains a lobulated and
slightly irregular mass with mild T2 bright signal and increasing
enhancement over time located superior and medial to the surgical
scar. This measures 12 x 8 mm (image 19) and likely corresponds
to the sonographic mass. There is an area of vague non mass
enhancement, enhancement increasing over time, located inferior to
this at the surgical site (image 19). This may be parenchymal or
post operative change.

Left breast contains several small areas of focal non mass
enhancement with no T2 bright signal, all nonspecific and possibly
parenchymal:
- upper outer linear middle third - 10 x 6 mm (image 10)
- 12 o'clock anterior - 11 x 9 mm (image 15)

Right breast contains several small areas of focal non mass
enhancement with irregular margins and no T2 bright signal, all
nonspecific and possibly parenchymal:
- upper inner middle third - 7 mm (image 64)
- 6 o'clock middle third - 5 mm (image 71)
- upper outer posterior - 5 mm (image 73)
- lower outer linear middle third - 10 x 3 mm (image 76).

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Mass right breast suspicious of malignancy
Postmenopausal

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1

( cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Outside mammograms and ultrasound from CML
Healthcare 2010

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with
minimal background parenchymal enhancement. No suspicious finding
in the left breast. In the right breast there is a large
irregular heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring 5 cm in the SI
dimension, 5 cm in the AP dimension and 3.3 cm in the transverse
dimension. The AP dimension includes a satellite lesion
anteriorly. The mass is mainly posteriorly, laterally and
inferiorly but extends across the nipple line into the medial and
superior breast. No involvement of skin or pectoralis muscle is
evident. There are at least 2 abnormally enlarged level 1 and 2
axillary nodes.

OPINION: Large malignancy in the right breast with metastatic
axillary nodes. Right mammogram, right breast and axillary
ultrasound with core biopsy of the mass and fine needle aspiration
of abnormal axillary node suggested.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Recurrent mastitis right breast.
Intraductal echogenic filling defect on the right noted on recent
ultrasound, scheduled for excision. Exclusion of additional
pathology.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate amount of breast parenchyma with mild
background stippled enhancement.

Within the central medial aspect of the right breast, there is a
small high T2 lobulated benign-appearing lesion measuring at 7 x 5
x 5 mm; most likely a small fibroadenoma. There is mild
tram-track enhancement superiorly at the midline, otherwise, no
corresponding lesion is noted at the expected region of the
echogenic ultrasound lesion. No other abnormalities are noted on
the right.

The left breast demonstrates a small focus (2.1 x 3.0 cm) of
asymmetric enhancement the upper outer quadrant. In addition,
there is a mild degree of distortion associated with this region
of asymmetry. This focus demonstrates a persistent enhancement
pattern.

OPINION:

No MR correlate to the intraductal lesion on the right is noted.
The remainder of the right breast is unremarkable.

Asymmetric focus of enhancement associated with mild distortio,
possible asymmetric normal parenchyma, however, further evaluation
with a second look ultrasound is warranted. If this region is not
visualized under ultrasound, an MR guided core biopsy is advised
due to possible distortion. This will be facilitated by our
department.

COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated 07 Nov 2009

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted  3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:7.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast (10 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

FINDINGS: Both the breasts show mild amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild background enhancement.

Image 69 shows a focal area of non-mass like enhancement in the central thirds of the right upper inner quadrant measuring 2.2cm (AP) x 2.1cm (SI) x 0.5cm (Trv) and showing delayed plateau enhancement kinetics.

No other suspicious enhancement noted in either breast.

No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy noted.

IMPRESSION: Focal non-mass like enhancement in the right breast as described above.

We will call this patient back for further evaluation with the help of right mammogram and targeted right breast ultrasound. If no mammographic or sonographic correlate noted then MR guided biopsy would be recommended.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Right nipple discharge with galactogram and ultrasound findings suggesting DCIS  Post menopausal

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted  3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.4, TR:7.0) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast (6 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammograms and ultrasound of 2011

FINDINGS: There is a mild scattered fibroglandular tissue with mild amount of moderate intensity stippled parenchymal enhancement bilaterally. There are a few small simple and complicated cysts bilaterally.  There are signal void artifacts in the
upper aspect of the left breast from previous surgery.  No suspicious enhancement is identified in the left breast.

On the right there are ectatic ducts with high T2 and high T1 precontrast signal with segmental linear, tubular and ringlike non-mass enhancement superiorly in the 12 o'clock radius but extending both medially and laterally.  This extends for a
distance of approximately 8 cm from the nipple superiorly and posteriorly.  In the immediate left subareolar region there is a 7 mm ring enhancing mass corresponding to that identified on mammography and ultrasound.  On image 71 in the middle third
slightly inferior and lateral to the nipple line is a 7 mm mass with high T2 signal and non-enhancing internal septations which is likely a fibroadenoma.  No abnormal axillary nodes are seen.

OPINION:  Segmental non-mass enhancement in the right breast superiorly suggestive of DCIS in keeping with the mammography and ultrasound findings.  Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of the subareolar mass could be done.  The right palpable
finding may correspond to the more superior extent of enhancement seen on MRI.  If breast conserving surgery is contemplated and a positive diagnosis is obtained from the subareolar mass, further biopsy of the more superior area with ultrasound or
MRI guidance should be considered.

(5.3 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

LMP: 20 years ago

REFERENCE EXAM: Compared to prior imaging.

FINDINGS:

There is a small amount of scattered fibroglandular tissue with a moderate amount of moderate intensity heterogeneous stippled background enhancement which is increased from prior.

Bilateral distortion is present mainly in the inferior breasts related to prior breast reduction surgery.

Multiple bilateral areas of non-mass enhancement are seen which are fairly symmetric and are more prominent when compared to prior MR imaging dating back to 2007. No focal mass.

No adenopathy.

IMPRESSION:

No evidence of malignancy.

New and increasing areas of bilateral non-mass enhancement are present in both breasts and are favored to represent benign parenchymal enhancement. Clinical correlation regarding history of hormone or homeopathic supplements is recommended.
Recommend follow-up MRI in 6 months after cessation of any such supplements.

FINDINGS:
There is a large volume of breast tissue with a marked degree of moderate intensity of enhancement. This limits the sensitivity of MRI.

LEFT:
There is mass enhancement at 3 o'clock that likely corresponds to the biopsied 3 o'clock calcifications (image 16).  It measures 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm, has low to intermediate T2 signal and has progressive enhancement.

A 1 .6 x 2 .4 x 1 .1 cm area of clumped non-mass progressive enhancement at 12 o'clock in the left breast likely corresponds to the biopsied calcifications at 12 o'clock (image 20).  This area demonstrates enhancement and signal characteristics
similar to background parenchyma.

In the central left breast is a 1.3 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm bright T1, bright T2 signal non enhancing mass, compatible with post-biopsy hematoma (image 21)

RIGHT-

No definite suspicious enhancement in the right breast.

NODES-
There are no abnormal lymph nodes.

IMPRESSION:


Marked degree of background enhancement limits the sensitivity of the study. Suggest six month followup MRI for further evaluation.

Enhancement at 12 and 3 o'clock in the left breast as described above most likely corresponds to the location of the previously biopsied calcifications in the left breast (result: ADH and FEA at both sites).

As noted previously vacuum assisted stereotactic biopsy of the 12 o'clock calcifications could be considered to further reduce the possibility of histologic underestimation.  Alternatively, the areas could be localized with mammographic guidance and
excised. I leave this to your office to arrange as clinically indicated.

LMP: July 15, 2011

FINDINGS: moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild degree of mild intensity background enhancement.

In the lower outer left breast posterior third, images 12 to 15, there is an area of inhomogeneous non mass enhancement 34 x 12 mm.  This may be in the area of the faint calcifications. This shows rapid initial and delayed plateau enhancement with a
nodular area of washout kinetics. Isointense on T2WI.

No suspicious enhancement in the right breast particularly in the area of the post biopsy clip and calcifications.

One low right axillary node may have asymmetrical cortical thickening.

SUMMARY:

1.No suspicious enhancement in the right breast.  The calcifications and the post biopsy clip could be localized under mammographic guidance for excisional biopsy.  Prior to this it has been recommended that the area be assessed with ultrasound to
rule out a mass.  Also the prominent low axillary node on the right should be assessment with ultrasound and US FNAB if suspicious.

2.  Area of non mass enhancement lower outer left breast in an area of faint calcifications.  Further assessment with additional mammograms and ultrasound recommended.  If there are no findings that warrant biopsy then MR guided biopsy recommended.

These appointments will be facilitated.

FINDINGS:

There is a large volume of breast tissue bilaterally, with moderate amount of mild intensity homogeneous regional background enhancement bilaterally.

RIGHT BREAST:

In the right lower inner quadrant, previously described foci of enhancement have significantly enlarged.  There are now at least 2 adjacent masses oriented vertically in the breast, image 61, in the posterior third of the right lower inner quadrant.
 They are both hypervascular with washout and have more than doubled in size compared to previous.  They each measure 0.8 x 0.6 by 0.5 cm (previously 0.3 - 0.4cm in longest dimensions).  They are oval in shape, however the more cranial lesion
demonstrates some irregularity along its superior and posterior margin.  These two masses are associated with clumped linear enhancement which extends anteromedially from the more inferior mass toward nipple by 3.3cm (and 0.4cm  x 0.4cm thickness).
Previously this clumped enhancement was a tiny nonspecific focus only 0.4cm in length.

Separate from above, in the upper outer right breast, there is a 0.8cm area of clumped non mass enhancement image 68, associated with stippled enhancement in a segmental distribution, clearly asymmetric with the contralateral breast.  This is not
specific, however given its distribution and asymmetry, requires correlation with biopsy.

LEFT BREAST:

There is a 1.1cm area of linear non mass enhancement in the lower outer quadrant, posterior third, which is stable, image 12.

There is a 0.5cm lobulated mass in the lower inner quadrant, posterior third.  It is hypovascular, demonstrates slow progressive enhancement, is bright on T2, may contain central fat and is completely stable, image 19.  This is a possible node,
though the enhancement characteristics are atypical, ddx small fibroadenoma.

No concerning enhancement on the left.

OPINION:

RIGHT:
Recommend second look ultrasound and biopsy of right breast for enlarging masses in the lower inner quadrant.  If not visible on ultrasound, MRI guided biopsy suggested.  BIRADS 4C.

Non mass enhancement in the right upper outer breast can be correlated at time of ultrasound, and if not seen, then MRI guided biopsy is suggested.  BIRADS 4.

FINDINGS:

There is a small amount of fibroglandular tissue with minimal degree/intensity background enhancement.

Stable 5 mm enhancing mass in the right lower outer breast (image 71) is most in keeping with an intramammary node. Previously noted left central breast lesion is not enhancing today and is much less conspicuous.

There is a 5 mm round enhancing lesion in the right upper outer breast (image 75) with rapid early enhancement and washout. It is slightly T2 hyperintense.  It possibly represents an intramammary lymph node and may have been present in 2009
measuring 0.3 cm.  However, it is not seen on the 2008 MR images.

No adenopathy.

IMPRESSION: Possible right upper outer intramammary node (image 75).  Recommend correlation with targeted second look ultrasound. If not seen sonographically, MRI biopsy is recommended.

Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3) were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.  Diffusion weighted imaging was performed.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Recent breast imaging March and April, 2011.  Prior MRI February, 2007.

LMP: March 28, 2011.

FINDINGS: Breasts are composed of a mostly fibroglandular tissue.  There is a mild degree of mild intensity background stippled parenchymal enhancement in both breasts.  There are scattered cysts measuring up to 9 mm in both breasts, some mildly complicated and rim enhancing.

LEFT BREAST: No concerning abnormality.  No definite enhancing abnormality corresponding to probable small fibroadenoma on ultrasound of February, 2011.

RIGHT BREAST: In the posterior lower outer quadrant just lateral to the nipple axis.  A lobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring 0.9 cm (image 65) with a marked degree of rapid initial and washout delay enhancement with restricted diffusion corresponding to the biopsy proven invasive ductal carcinoma.  No additional concerning abnormality.

Low level 1/junction intramammary lymph node lateral 9 o'clock (image 70) was better characterized on recent ultrasound and was morphologically normal appearing.

AXILLA: No abnormal lymph nodes.

INCIDENTAL FINDINGS: Hypointense focus in the midsternum on T1 weighted imaging pre-and post fat suppression with no enhancement, unchanged from MRI 2007 in keeping with an incidental benign lesion.

OPINION: Suspicious mass lower outer right breast corresponds to known carcinoma, uni-centric on MRI. (BI-RADS:  6)

REFERENCE EXAM: Previous including bilateral mammograms August 2010 and MRI December 2009

FINDINGS: moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild degree of moderate intensity background enhancement. Bilateral post operative scarring.

In the lateral right breast, image 82, 9 o'clock mid third there is an irregular heterogenous enhancing area of non mass enhancement 15 AP x 13 SI x 9 TV mm. This shows rapid initial and delayed plateau enhancement with moderate T2WI signal. There
is a history of previous surgery in this approximate area showing ADH and radial scar. This appears to be part of a larger non enhancing area that is unchanged. ALthough the enhancement is mildly more prominent this is likely benign and probably due
to fat necrosis.

No evidence of lymphadenopathy.

SUMMARY: No suspicious enhancement left breast.

The changes in the upper outer right breast are probably benign and possible due to fat necrosis from previous reduction mammoplasties and excisional biopsy. The 2002 surgery was not done here and therefore the exact surgical site is unknown.
Further assessment with right mammograms and ultrasound recommended. If no suspicious findings to biopsy, then follow up MRI in six months recommended.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of 2011 and 2012

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally.  Marked degree and intensity of background parenchymal enhancement.

In the left breast, image 18-20 , irrregular area of mass enhancement measuring 11 by 28 x 18 (SI by AP by TV) This shows rapid initial enhancement with washout.  It is located at 12 o'clock, middle third of the breast.  There may be some associated
architectural distortion.  There is a second area of enhancement, image 17 approximately 2 cm above the first one which shows also some mild architectural distortion.  It shows rapid initial enhancement with plateau.  No T2 signal in either area.

In the right breast also at 12 o'clock (image 70) is a irregular inhomogeneous mass enhancement measuring approximately 11 mm which is bright on T2.  It contains nonenhancing septations.  It shows rapid initial enhancement with washout.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.

On the axial, image 95, there is a well-defined vein 2.1 cm mass in the right cardiophrenic angle.  This is hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 and shows very little rim enhancement.  It is most likely a pericardial cyst but can be confirmed with

FINDINGS: The study is degraded by movement artefacts. There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild degree of mild to moderate intensity background enhancement.

Corresponding with the new mammographic mass, image 15, upper inner left breast there is a lobulated 13 x 10 mm mass with rapid early and progressive delayed enhancement. Mass is bright on T2WI and has non enhancing septations. This is new but
otherwise has features of a fibroadenoma.

In addition

-image 12, post third central left breast no change 7 mm enhancing mass, T2 bright, non enhancing septations, consistent with fibroadenoma.

-image 62, posterior third, 6 mm progressively enhancing non mass enhancement at 6 o'clock right breast, no T2 signal, probably parenchymal, likely no change
-image 64, mid third lower outer right breast, 6 mm progressively enhancing non mass enhancement, no T2 signal, probably parenchymal.
-image 65, anterior third lower outer right breast, 6 mm well defined enhancing mass, T2 bright consistent with new small fibroadenoma.

-previous enhancing mass lower inner left breast no longer enhancing.

INDICATION:  Surveillance.  BRCA 1.  Post menopausal.

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:7.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast (5.0 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.  Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS:  Small amount breast tissue with mild degree/intensity enhancement.

Right upper inner posterior reniform shaped mass, T2 bright, with some decrease of enhancement over time - 7 x 3 x 5 mm and 9.1 cm from the nipple (image 67).  This is questionably seen on some prior scans on T2 weighted images however the
enhancement is new on the current study and this is overall more apparent.

No abnormal mass or enhancement in the left breast.  No abnormal lymphadenopathy.

IMPRESSION:  Right upper inner posterior lesion, possibly an intra mammary lymph node.  The medial and far posterior location would make MRI biopsy technically challenging and perhaps not possible.  Recommend targeted second look ultrasound.  If not
seen, recommend 6 month MRI follow up; we will leave this to  your office to arrange for the patient.

CLINICAL INDICATION:   1 year f/u of non mass enhancement right breast.  Significant family history of breast CA.  Previous contralateral excisional biopsies of papillomas 2008, 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGRbilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  MRI 3/11/2010

FINDINGS:

There is a small volume of breast tissue bilaterally, with a minimal volume of mild intensity background parenchymal enhancement.

No concerning enhancement in the left breast.  Stable left lower outer quadrant nodules since September 2008, probable intramammary nodes.

The right breast lower outer quadrant demonstrates segmental, non mass enhancement, and while distribution of enhancement has remained stable, the morphology is questionably more clumped .  This persistent segmental enhancement maybe stable
parenchymal enhancement, but stable DCIS cannot be excluded with this morphology, and MRI guided bx is suggested.

No adenopathy.  No mammographic correlate to non mass enhancement in the right breast.


OPINION:

Suggest MRI guided biopsy as above.  BIRADS 4.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION:  Probable carcinoma 6 o'clock right breast corresponds with clinical, mammographic and ultrasound finding.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer,  sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3) were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

LMP: March 19, 2011.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammograms and ultrasound March 14, 2011.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue.  Moderate degree of mild intensity diffuse heterogeneous and mild stippled background parenchymal enhancement.  1 cm cyst upper outer quadrant left breast.

LEFT BREAST: Lobulated mass with irregular margins 6 o'clock left breast measuring 2 x 2 2.2 cm (image 19) corresponds to a probable carcinoma.  Marked degree of rapid initial and heterogeneous internal washout enhancement with areas of rim
enhancement.

There are 2 reniform shaped satellite nodules adjacent to the chest wall, with a marked degree of rapid initial and washout delayed enhancement both at a distance of 9 mm from the dominant mass in a postero-cephalad direction (image 19 and 21)
measuring 3 and 5 mm.  These are adjacent to small branches of the left internal mammary vessels, and typical distribution for intramammary lymph nodes.

Additional probably benign lesions, features consistent with probable fibroadenomas as follows:
1) upper outer quadrant/central, posterior 1/3 (image 15) -- 8mm, most likely to correspond to sonographic probable fibroadenoma,
2) central, middle 1/3 (image 15) -- 4 mm, and
3) upper inner quadrant (image 24) -- 4 mm.

RIGHT BREAST: Negative.  Specifically no enhancing abnormality or definite finding to correspond to the sonographically identified probably benign masses.

AXILLA: Indeterminant level 1 left axillary lymph node due to thickening of the cortex (5 mm), asymmetric when compared with the right axillary lymph nodes.

OTHER: No incidental findings.

OPINION: Suspicious mass on MRI, ultrasound and mammograms corresponding to a clinical abnormality 6 o'clock left breast is likely a carcinoma (BI-RADS: 5).  Indeterminate level 1 left axillary lymph node.  Ultrasound guided biopsy of the mass and
fine needle aspiration biopsy of lymph node have been recommended.

2 satellite nodules and a distance of 9 mm from the dominant left breast mass against the chest wall are suspected to represent intramammary lymph nodes, while not significantly enlarged, given proximity to the tumor are potentially involved and
should be excised at the time of surgery.

Probably benign small masses in the left breast, not all identified on prior ultrasound.  6 month follow-up MRI recommended (BI-RADS: 3).  The previously identified right breast probably benign masses on ultrasound are not correlated on MRI.

INDICATION:  Left lower outer breast mass seen on recent mammogram and ultrasound, for evaluation.  LMP end of July 2011.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral
images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium
contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.  This is the first breast MRI.

FINDINGS:  Moderate amount breast tissue with mild degree/intensity enhancement.

In the left lower outer posterior breast there is a rim enhancing mass.  This lies 6.5 cm from the nipple and measures 3.3 AP x 3.0 CC x 2.1 TV cm (image 11).  The rim is thick and irregular and shows plateauing enhancement over time.  Centrally,
the mass is non enhancing and T2 bright indicating central necrosis.  This lies near the chest wall but no invasion is seen.  This corresponds to the mass seen on mammogram and ultrasound.  The 4 mm satellite nodule located 4 mm to the mass seen on
ultrasound is not correlated on MRI, and may lie within the surrounding rim enhancement.

Extending anteriorly from the mass in the left lower outer quadrant, and extending slightly into the lower inner quadrant, is an area of regional non mass enhancement.  This extends from the posterior to the anterior breast but does not extend into
the nipple, and measures 6.3 AP x 5.5 CC x 2.9 TV cm (image 14).

In the left lower inner quadrant anteriorly there is a vertically oriented tubular area of enhancement which is T2 bright and shows plateauing enhancement.  It measures 1.8 CC x 0.5 AP x 1.6 TV cm (image 22).

The sonographic lesions seen in the left breast at 2:30 and 6 o'clock are not correlated on MRI.  Both were favored to be benign on ultrasound.

There is a well defined lobulated mass in the right breast 6 o'clock posterior third measuring 2.2 cm (image 65).  This is iso-intense on T1 and T2, and does not show enhancement.  This corresponds to the mass seen on ultrasounds of 2006, 2007, and
2008 (where it was described in the 9 o'clock position 4 cm from the nipple), and is in keeping with a fibroadenoma.

There is poor fat saturation in the axilla, limiting evaluation.  There are 2 probable enlarged nodes in the left mid axilla levels 1 and 2, the largest measuring 2.2 x 2.2 cm.  Enlarged nodes were seen on ultrasound.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Left lower outer posterior mass, suspicious and seen on mammogram and ultrasound.  Ultrasound guided core biopsy is recommended.  Please submit a requisition for this to our department.

2.  Left lower outer (and lower inner) non mass enhancement, nonspecific.  Recommend second look ultrasound.  If not seen, recommend MRI guided biopsy.

3.  Left lower inner anterior enhancement, nonspecific.  Recommend second look ultrasound.  If not seen, recommend 6 month MRI follow up.

4.  The left breast 2:30 and 6 o'clock lesions seen on ultrasound are not correlated on MRI and were favored to be benign on ultrasound.  Recommend 6 month ultrasound follow up.

5.  Enlarged left axillary level 1 and 2 lymph nodes, better seen on ultrasound.  Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration is recommended.   Please submit a requisition for this to our department.

If there is no additional report within 1 month, please contact our department.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION: Known right DCIS LMP Aug 18/10

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.6) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images
(TE:3.7, TR:7.8) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast
were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2,
under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(6.5 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram of Sept 2010.

FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense with a mild amount
of moderate intensity stippled background parenchymal enhancement.
There are small cysts bilaterally. No suspicious enhancement is
seen in the left breast.

On the right there is a large segmental area of non-mass
enhancement (images 70 - 79) corresponding to the area of
microcalcifications seen on the mammogram. This area contains
small cysts with high T2 and T1 precontrast signal suggesting the
presence of fluid and either proteinaceous material or blood.
This area measures at least 8 cm in AP dimension, 6 cm in the SI
and 3 cm in the transverse. In addition there is a separate 9 mm
focal area in the RUIQ posteriorly
image 65 showing rapid early and delayed plateau enhancement.
This is at least 1.5 cm medially to the large area of enhancement.

No involvement of chest wall or skin is evident. No obviously
abnormal axillary nodes are seen but there is a right axillary
node with an eccentrically thickened cortex.

OPINION: Suspicious MRI findings in the area of the known
malignancy corresponding to the suspicious microcalcifications
seen on mammography. In addition there is a focal area in the
right upper inner quadrant which is of concern. If breast
conservation surgery is being contemplated, further investigation
of this area with mammographic views and ultrasound and possible
biopsy would be suggested. If no mammographic or ultrasound
correlate is found then an MRI guided biopsy would be suggested.
Ultrasound evaluation of the right axillary nodes is also
suggested. Requisitions would need to be sent to the Department
before these will be be arranged.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Bilateral or needle biopsies. The right
breast with a diagnosis of atypical ductal epithelial hyperplasia
with microcalcifications and adenosis. Left breast severe
atypical intraductal proliferative lesion

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images
(TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted
fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post
gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT
(108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D
FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral mammogram 11/29/2010

FINDINGS:

Large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Moderate
degree in density or background parenchymal enhancement.

In the left breast, extending from the subareolar region,
extending superiorly, inferiorly and medially is a lobulated
irregular area of enhancement with some areas showing rim
enhancement with washout. This measures approximately 4.6 by 2.2
by 2 cm (SI by AP by TV. No corresponding T2 signal. Some of the
enhancement corresponds to the area of microcalcifications seen on
the mammogram particularly in the upper outer quadrant.

The right breast has a similar appearance and measures 6 by 2.4 by
2 cm. Some of the areas of enhancement again corresponds to the
area of microcalcifications seen on the mammogram. The most
suspicious areas of enhancement is in the subareolar region
extending inferiorly toward 6 o'clock and laterally towards 9
o'clock. Some of the suspicious areas and enhancement correspond
to the area of microcalcifications in the upper outer quadrant of
the right breast.
IMPRESSION:

Bilateral suspicious areas of enhancement which implies a
significant portion of the breasts bilaterally. Bilateral
targeted ultrasound suggested to the area of abnormalities
described on the MRI with view to biopsy and exclude the diagnosis
of invasive disease since a diagnosis ADH were obtained
bilaterally of the microcalcifications.

If the ultrasound is negative, consideration should be given to
MRI guided biopsy of both breasts, on the left in the subareolar
region of one of the enhancing masses and on the right also
subareolar of one of the rim enhancing masses again.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of May 2011

FINDINGS:

Large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally.  Marked degree and intensity of background parenchymal enhancement limiting the sensitivity of the examination.

Corresponding to the area of microcalcifications in the medial aspect of the right breast on image 35 is an 8 mm rapidly enhancing mass with plateau on delayed phase.  This is in the posterior third at 3 o'clock in the measures approximately 8.4 mm.
 This most likely corresponds to the most medial cluster of microcalcifications.  The other areas of microcalcifications seen on the mammogram probably corresponds to 2 other areas of enhancement seen on image 57 in the anterior third measuring 8.1
and 4.4 mm.  The most anterior cluster which is located in the subareolar region is lost in the background of parenchymal enhancement.  The area of disease can be estimated at approximately 17 by 50 mm (SI by AP) but is better estimated on the
mammogram.

In the left breast, area of linear non-mass enhancement extending to the middle and posterior third of the breast (images 14 to 19)measuring approximately 5.7 by 4.4 cm (SI by AP) occupying the outer quadrant.  This shows rapid initial and plateau.
It is indeterminate.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.

IMPRESSION:

The area of suspicious microcalcifications seen on the mammogram are not as well seen on MRI.  These areas of microcalcifications should be biopsied under stereotactic guidance as suggested on the mammography report.

Non-mass enhancement occupying the outer quadrant of the left breast from 2 to 4 o'clock.  A targeted sonographic evaluation suggested and if not seen, MRI guided biopsy of the superior area of enhancement in inferior area of enhancement suggested.

REFERENCE EXAM: Mammogram and ultrasound of 2011

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue with a moderate amount and intensity diffuse background parenchymal enhancement which limits the examination.  No suspicious finding is idenitified in the right breast.

The previously noted suspicious mass in the left subareolar region medially is a heterogeneously enhancing spiculated mass measuring approximately 1.8 cm in the AP dimension, 1.4 cm in the SI dimension and 1.5 cm in transverse.  This does involve
the nipple areolar complex.  No abnormal axillary nodes are seen.

OPINION: Unifocal left subareolar malignancy for which an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy is recommended.  Appointment will be facilitated but requisition is required.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of 2013 and MRIs of 2010 and 2012

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with a moderate amount and intensity diffuse and stippled background parenchymal enhancement increased from previously.  This limits accuracy.

There are small cysts bilaterally.  Previously noted small masses left breast are less apparent.

There are more prominent linear non-mass enhancements bilaterally such as in the left lower outer quadrant image 19 and the right upper inner quadrant posteriorly image 62.

OPINION:  Increased background parenchymal enhancements limits accuracy. The non mass enhancement in the left LOQ is likely physiological and a 6 month follow up is suggested.  Requisition is required.  BI-RADS 3

--- Addendum ---
The size of the new linear non-mass enhancement in the right upper inner quadrant is approximately 1 cm.  Since this is now biopsy proven DCIS, an MRI guided biopsy of the linear non-mass enhancement in the left lower outer quadrant inferiorly would
be reasonable.  However its superficial location may make this technically difficult.  Requisition would be required.

CLINICAL INDICATION: HIgh risk  LMP Apr 16/13  Previous excision of breast tissue from axillary tails bilaterally

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 83, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted  3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.4, TR:7.0) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (6
cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of 2013 and MRIs of 2010 and 2012

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with a moderate amount and intensity diffuse and stippled background parenchymal enhancement increased from previously.  This limits accuracy.

There are small cysts bilaterally.  Previously noted small masses left breast are less apparent.

There are more prominent linear non-mass enhancements bilaterally such as in the left lower outer quadrant image 19 and the right upper inner quadrant posteriorly image 62.

OPINION:  Increased background parenchymal enhancements limits accuracy. The non mass enhancement in the left LOQ is likely physiological and a 6 month follow up is suggested.  Requisition is required.  BI-RADS 3

CLINICAL INDICATION:  Screening - Greater than 25% lifetime risk.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1
weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  MRI 1/4/2009, Mammogram 9/26/2011,  US 9/17/2009.

LMP:January 11, 2012.

FINDINGS:
There is a large amount of background parenchyma with  marked degree and intensity of enhancement.  There are bilateral cysts as well as high T1 and T2 duct signal.

LEFT-
There is a stable 0.7 cm mass in the upper inner breast (image 27). It has progressive enhancement and high T2 signal. There is no associated architectural distortion. It likely represents a benign fibroadenoma.

In the lower inner breast there is a smooth ovoid mass measuring 0.7 cm (image 23). It displays mild progressive enhancement and mildly high T2 signal. There is no associated architectural distortion. The features are not concerning.

RIGHT-
In the lower outer breast there is a new mass measuring 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm (image 71).  It demonstrates washout enhancement and is isointense to parenchyma on T2. There is no corresponding architectural distortion.

NODES-
There are right axillary lymph nodes not enlarged by size criteria, however they are more prominent than on the left.

OTHER-
The superficial superior tiny hypointensity in the liver is stable.

IMPRESSION:
New suspicious mass in the right breast should be further assessed by ultrasound with a view to biopsy.  If no ultrasound correlate is identified, then an MRI biopsy should be completed.
A right axillary ultrasound with a possible FNA is also recommended.
The appointment for this workup will be facilitated by our department. If you do not receive a report from the work up within one month, please contact our department.

degrades images.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mamogram and ultrasound of July 2011

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue with a mild amount of moderate intensity stippled background parenchymal enhancement.

The known malignancy  in the right 9 o'clock position posteriorly image 69 is an irregular heterogeneously rim enhancing mass measuring a maximum of approximately 1.7 cm.  This contains a high T2 component which is possibly related to the biopsy.
Anterior, superior and medial to this in the 12 o'clock position image 65 there is an irregular heterogeneously enhancing 1 cm mass which is suspicious of a second site of malignancy.  This is about 3.5 cm from the known malignancy in the sagittal
plane.  A signal void artifact is present posteriorly superiorly on image 66-67.  The right axillary nodes are not well demonstrated and are indeterminate.

No suspicious finding is identified in the left breast.

OPINION:  In addition to the known right malignancy there is a second suspicious mass in the right 12 o'clock position likely corresponding to the additional mass identified on ultrasound.   Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of the mass and fine
needle aspiration of the indeterminate right axillary node seen on ultrasound are suggested.  Requisitions are required.

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral mammogram 11/29/2010

FINDINGS:

Large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Moderate
degree in density or background parenchymal enhancement.

In the left breast, extending from the subareolar region,
extending superiorly, inferiorly and medially is a lobulated
irregular area of enhancement with some areas showing rim
enhancement with washout. This measures approximately 4.6 by 2.2
by 2 cm (SI by AP by TV. No corresponding T2 signal. Some of the
enhancement corresponds to the area of microcalcifications seen on
the mammogram particularly in the upper outer quadrant.

The right breast has a similar appearance and measures 6 by 2.4 by
2 cm. Some of the areas of enhancement again corresponds to the
area of microcalcifications seen on the mammogram. The most
suspicious areas of enhancement is in the subareolar region
extending inferiorly toward 6 o'clock and laterally towards 9
o'clock. Some of the suspicious areas and enhancement correspond
to the area of microcalcifications in the upper outer quadrant of
the right breast.
IMPRESSION:

Bilateral suspicious areas of enhancement which implies a
significant portion of the breasts bilaterally. Bilateral
targeted ultrasound suggested to the area of abnormalities
described on the MRI with view to biopsy and exclude the diagnosis
of invasive disease since a diagnosis ADH were obtained
bilaterally of the microcalcifications.

If the ultrasound is negative, consideration should be given to
MRI guided biopsy of both breasts, on the left in the subareolar
region of one of the enhancing masses and on the right also
subareolar of one of the rim enhancing masses again.

gadolinium contrast was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of Apr 2011

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with a marked amount of moderate intensity diffuse and stippled background parenchymal enhancement.  No concerning finding in the left breast.

On the right there is a 4 mm mass, image 82 in the 630 position middle third showing rapid early and delayed washout.  There is a slightly increased T2 signal.  There is a low right axillary node with a slightly eccentrically thickened cortex
although the fatty hilum is maintained.

OPINION: Small mass in the right breast is possibly a fibroadenoma.  However ultrasound of the right breast and axilla is recommended with view to biopsy if an abnormality is identified.  If it is not found on ultrasound, an MRI guided biopsy is
suggested.

Stable 1.2 cm nonmass linear enhancement left anterior breast, 3 o'clock (image 20) and 0.6 cm nonmass linear enhancement in the mid third at 12 o'clock, image 24.

Stable 9 o'clock 5.7 x 1.5 cm area of linear nonmass enhancement with postbiopsy clip (images 73 and 74).

Linear nonmass enhancement measuring 3.7 cm (AP) in the right upper central breast (image 69) is more prominent compared to previous.

No lymphadenopathy.

IMPRESSION:

Indeterminate linear nonmass enhancement in the right upper central breast (image 69). Suggest correlation with right mammogram and ultrasound with view to biopsy. If no mammographic or sonographic correlate, suggest MRI guided biopsy.

Remainder, not significantly changed and should be followed with MRI in 6 months.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Recurrent mass left breast  Previous resection large complex fibroadenoma in 2006.  LMP 2 weeks ago

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted  3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.5, TR:7.1) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast (7 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of 2011 and MRI of 2005

FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with a moderate amount of moderate intensity background parenchymal enhancement.  There are small cysts bilaterally more in the left breast than the right.  No suspicious enhancement in
the right breast.

On the left corresponding to the mammographic and ultrasound findings is a large multilobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring 7.2 cm in SI, 6.1 cm in the transverse and 5.9 cm in the AP dimensions.  This is centrally extending superior
and inferior to the nipple line and predominantly medially but extending lateral to the nipple line.  This shows high T2 signal through much of mass with high T1 signal pre-contrast indicating blood or proteinaceous material within cystic spaces.
This abuts the pectoralis muscle but no abnormal enhancement of the muscle is evident. As on ultrasound there are slightly prominent but not definitely abnormal left axillary nodes.

OPINION: Large multilobulated mass in the central left breast suggestive of a phyllodes tumor but carcinoma could be considered.  Further investigation with biopsy under ultrasound guidance has been recommended.

TECHNIQUE: Localizer, axial T1 weighted images gradient through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted fat saturated images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images pre and post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using
VIBRANT. Post imaging subtraction and MIP images were obtained. 5 cc of Gadovist were administered.

FINDINGS:
Heterogeneous dense breasts.

The left breast shows no suspicious enhancement.

The right breast shows linear non-mass enhancement in the retroareolar region measuring 0.9 cm (A-P) x 0.3 cm (S-I) (image 61) with no corresponding T2 signal.  There is high T2 signal in what appears to be a dilated duct just anterior and possibly
posterior to the regions of enhancement (image 20-21).

IMPRESSION:
Findings of linear non-mass enhancement in the right breast as described above are suspicious.  Recommend ultrasound and ductogram for further characterisation and possible biopsy.  If the area cannot be located by either of the above techniques,
recommend MRI guided biopsy.

A verbal report will be called by our department to organise the appropriate requisitions to facilitate additional imaging and biopsy.

CLINICAL INDICATION: HIgh risk  LMP Aug 29/12

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted  3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.5, TR:7.1) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium
contrast (6 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of August 2012 and MRIs of 2008 and 2011

FINDINGS: There is a marked amount of fibroglandular tissue with a marked amount and intensity stippled background parenchymal enhancement bilaterally.  Examination is poorly timed to menstrual cycle and the amount of background enhancement limits
the accuracy of the examination.  There are many more foci present while others have regressed.

There are small simple and complicated cysts present.

Signal void artifact related to the post biopsy clip is noted in the right breast anteriorly image 72.  The adjacent targeted biopsied nodule is smaller than originally.

No concerning change in the previously described masses bilaterally.

On image 58 in the right upper inner quadrant there is a rapidly heterogeneously ring enhancing 6 mm mass with delayed washout.  There is no associated T2 signal.  This appears to be gradually increasing in size compared to prior examinations.  The
mass superior to this on image 57 shows T2 signal.

No lymphadenopathy is identified.

OPINION: This examination is poorly timed to menstrual cycle and background enhancement limits accuracy.  The mass described in the right upper inner quadrant image 58 is of concern.  Targeted ultrasound is suggested with view to biopsy.  If not
identified on ultrasound an MRI guided biopsy is recommended.

VIBRANT. Post imaging subtraction and MIP images were obtained. 6 cc of Gadovist was administered.

CLINICAL HISTORY: High risk screening. Mother diagnosed with breast cancer.

REFERENCE EXAMS: Multiple previous mammograms.  The most recent from the same day. No previous MRI studies.

LMP: September 6, 2011.

FINDINGS:
Breasts are dense with evidence of stippled background enhancement.

The left breast shows an area of clumped non-mass enhancement measuring 2.4 cm (A-P) x 1. 6 cm (S-I) (image 8) in the posterior third with a type 1 kinetic enhancement curve (slow initial and a continued rise).  There is also evidence of a well
circumscribed 5 mm mass posteriorly at 12 o'clock (image 13) with a type 1 kinetic enhancement curve (slow initial and a continued rise).

The right breast shows an area of linear clumped non-mass enhancement between 12 and 2 o'clock measuring 1.6 cm (S-I) x 0.7 cm (A-P) (image 48) with a type 1 kinetic enhancement curve (slow initial and a continued rise). In addition there are two
masses with non-enhancing internal septations also showing a type 1 kinetic enhancement curve (slow initial and a continued rise), the first measuring 0.8 cm (A-P) x 0.4 cm (S-I) at 7:30 and the second measuring 0.9 cm (A-P) x 0.7 cm (S-I) at 9:30
(image 55).

No evidence of enlarged axillary lymph nodes.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left non-mass enhancement between 1-3 o'clock, recommend ultrasound and biopsy.  This corresponds to the area of new calcifications on same day mammogram. (BIRADS 4).

2. Left well circumscribed 5 mm mass at 12 o'clock, recommend ultrasound and if not seen, follow up on MRI in 6 months. (BIRADS 3).

3. Right linear non-mass enhancement between 12-2 o'clock, recommend ultrasound and biopsy.  If not seen on ultrasound, an MRI biopsy is recommended. (BIRADS 4).

4. Right subcentimetre masses, recommend ultrasound and if not seen, follow up on MRI in 6 months. (BIRADS 3).

A verbal report will be called to facilitate requisitions required for the above recommendations.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: Screen. BRCA 1 carrier. Postmenopausal.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

COMPARISON: Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of breast tissue with mild degree and
intensity of enhancement.

Right upper inner enhancing 4 mm focus (image 63) with T2 bright
associated signal, increasing enhancement over time, and no
significant change from 2006. This is likely a fibroadenoma.

No other abnormal mass or enhancement. No suspicious
lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: There is no MRI evidence of malignancy. The next
bilateral mammogram is due in September 2010.

REFERENCE EXAM: Left breast ultrasound and mammogram of January
2010

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Bilateral
subpectoral saline implant intact. No significant background of
parenchymal enhancement.

No significant enhancement seen to correspond to the 2 sonographic
solid masses described at 12 o'clock and a 1230. On image 9 and
12 of T2, there is a 6 mm hyperintense mass on each image which
are slightly lobulated. These may correspond to the sonographic
solid masses. These masses showed very delayed enhancement seen
in the on the axial images (images 101 and 110)

In the subareolar region of the right breast, (image 64), there is
a 6 mm heterogeneous rapidly enhancing mass with plateau. It
contains some nonenhancing septations. No corresponding T2
weighted signal. Another similar mass is seen in approximately 7
mm lateral to this first mass with similar characteristics
measuring also 6 mm.

No other areas of enhancement.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

2 masses right breast with imaging features suggesting benign
masses such as fibroadenomas. Targeted sonographic evaluation of
the right breast suggested of the subareolar region and of 9
o'clock close to the nipple for further assessment. If not seen
on ultrasound, follow-up MRI can be done in 6 months. (BI-RADS:
3)

The 2 masses seen on ultrasound left breast are enhancing on only
on very delayed images which are in keeping with the diagnosis of
fibroadenomas (one of the masses was proven by core biopsy to be a
fibroadenoma). (BIRADS 2)

Please submit appropriate requisition for the additional imaging
right breast which will then be facilitated.

HISTORY:  Cowden's syndrome, high risk screening (>25%). Recent mammograms showed 10 mm dense circumscribed round mass superimposed on lateral right breast only on the CC view.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet with a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal

LMP:2007

REFERENCE EXAM:  MRI December 2008. Mammograms November 2010.

FINDINGS: Movement artefacts on subtracted images reduce sensitivity of study.

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with no significant background enhancement.  Increased signal central ducts on pre contrast T1WI due to proteinaceous material.

In the lower outer right breast, image 71, posterior third, there is well defined 10 mm mass, bright on T2WI inferior, increased signal pre contrast T1WI. There is progressive thin rim enhancement of the wall. This is consistent with a cyst with
proteinaceous or hemorrhagic material and possible corresponds to mass seen on mammograms. This was present in 2008 and measured 8 mm

SUMMARY: No suspicious enhancement. Complicated cyst lower outer right breast may correspond to mammographic mass seen only on one view. Additional imaging of the mammographic mass has been recommended.

sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:7.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast (7 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

FINDINGS: Both the breasts show moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild background enhancement.

LEFT BREAST: The previously noted non mass like enhancement in the lower outer quadrant and in the upper inner quadrant shows near complete resolution. Biopsy clip noted in the lower outer quadrant.

Focal areas of clumped non-mass like enhancement noted in the anterior thirds of the upper outer quadrant (image 13) and in the middle thirds of the central breast (image 17). These areas are new since prior and warrant biopsy under MR guidance.

RIGHT BREAST: No suspicious enhancement noted.
Stable focus of enhancement noted (image 75) in the upper central breast (stable since Oct 2008).

No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy seen.

IMPRESSION: MR findings reveal interval regression of enhancement in the LOQ and UIQ of the left breast.
There is interval appearance of new clumped focal non-mass like enhancements in the left breast as described above. They are unlikely to be seen on ultrasound and an MR guided biopsy is recommended(particularly of the anterior non mass like
enhancement in image 13). Please submit a requisition to facilitate the same.

--- Addendum ---
If the more anterior area biopsy result is benign, then the more posterior area of less prominent non-mass enhancement can be followed.

If the anterior biopsy is positive, and it important for clinical management, then the second area can be biopsied at that time.

CLINICAL INDICATION: 6 month follow-up of enhancing focus in the
LLOQ. No sonographic correlate. Prior benign surgical biopsy on
the right. LMP Dec. 3, 2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison is made to prior imaging including the
most recent MRI of 6/01/09.

FINDINGS: There is a large amount of breast tissue demonstrating a
marked degree and intensity of stippled enhancement which has
increased markedly since the prior exam and limits sensitivity.
The exam, it is noted, has been timed appropriately to the
menstrual cycle. There are a few, scattered cysts bilaterally.

The small enhancing focus in the LLOQ (image 12) has not changed
significantly since the prior exam measuring 5.2 mm (4.1 mm). It
shows, rapid enhancement and washout.

In the right breast, there is a small ring enhancing focus with T2
hyperintensity likely due to an inflamed cyst (image 58). There
is a new, 5-6 mm mass in the right breast, image 60 which shows
progressive enhancement.

There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes.

OPINION:

1. No significant interval change in the small enhancing focus in
the LLOQ. BIRADS 2.
2. Small inflamed cyst in right breast. BIRADS 2.
3. New mass in the right breast. Likely parenchymal. A second
look ultrasound is suggested +/- biopsy. If no sonographic
correlate is seen then a follow-up MRI is suggested in 6 months.
BIRADS 3.

A verbal report will be phoned in order to obtain the appropriate
requisition.

LMP: April 28 2011

REFERENCE EXAM:  previous breast imaging including mammograms January 2011 and MRI December 2009

FINDINGS: moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild degree of moderate intensity background enhancement.

In the superior central right breast posterior third, image 55, there is an 8 x 5 mm area of non mass enhancement. This shows rapid initial with delayed plateau enhancement. This appears to be new. This is a question of a non enhancing septation but
this is not T2 bright. While this may be parenchymal enhancement or a fibroadenoma this is new and biopsy is recommended in this clinical context.

Connected by a band of enhancement directed anterior and inferiorly there is a 2nd 4 mm focus of enhancement with similar kinetics located in the mid third of the breast in the line of the nipple, image 56. A similar finding was seen in 2009, image
59 and image 67 axial.

In the upper outer right breast, image 63, mid third of the breast there is a 5 mm reniform enhancing mass, moderately hyperintense on T2WI with an adjacent vessel. This is probably a lymph node.

No evidence of abnormal axillary nodes.

SUMMARY:

3 areas of enhancement right breast. Further assessment with mammograms and targeted ultrasound with view to biopsy recommended. If no ultrasound correlate for the finding on image 55 then MR guided biopsy recommended. The areas of enhancement image
63 and image 56 are probably benign and can be reassessed on 6 month follow up MRI.

No suspicous enhancement left breast.

LMP: February 9, 2011

REFERENCE EXAM:  previous mammograms including today's study.

FINDINGS: moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with marked degree of moderate intensity heterogeneous and stippled background enhancement reducing sensitivity of study. Several scattered cysts with the largest in the right breast 6 o'clock
measuring 17 mm. Some cysts have thin enhancing walls.

In the upper outer right breast anterior third, image 75, there is an irregular spiculated 9 mm heterogeneous enhancing mass with intermediate T2 signal. This show rapid initial with delayed washout and plateau enhancement.

Deep in the superior central right breast, image 68, there is a 5 mm lobulated enhancing mass, that probably corresponds to a stable mammographic mass. This shows rapid initial and progressive delayed enhancement.

No other suspicious breast findings.

No abnormal appearing axillary nodes.

There is large lobulated enhancing liver lesion, T2 bright and further assessment with CT scan recommended.

SUMMARY: suspicious mass upper outer right breast. US with view to biopsy recommended. If no US correlate then MR guided biopsy recommended. A verbal will be called and this appointment facilitated once a requisition is faxed to the department. The
differential includes a radial scar.

Enhancing mass 12 o'clock right breast likely benign and probably corresponds to stable mammographic mass. If not seen on US then follow up MRI in six months recommended. There are also multiple foci of background enhancement that need re-assessment
on MRI.

Enhancing liver lesion and CT scan recommended for further assessment.

FINDINGS: moderate to large amount of fibroglandular tissue with moderate to marked degree of moderate intensity stippled background enhancement.

In the anterior third of the upper inner right breast, images 65-69, there is an irregular area of both mass and non mass enhancement overall measuring 40 AP x 20 SI x 23 TV.  The 20 mass in the superficial aspect shows rapid initial and delayed
washout enhancement. There is no skin, chest wall or nipple areolar involvement. This corresponds with the mammographic asymmetry.

Closer to the nipple, images 70 to 74, in the mid third of the breast subareolar region 3 o'clock is an area of clumped non mass enhancement measuring 34 AP x 23 SI x 17 mm TV. This is located 4 cm inferior and lateral to the dominent mass. This
shows rapid initial and delayed progressive enhancement.

There is one right axillary node, image 43 axial, that may have thickened cortex.

SUMMARY:

Suspicious findings upper inner right breast. Further assessment with additional right mammograms, ultrasound right breast/axilla, and US core biopsy recommended and these appointments will be facilitated. US FNAB of right axillary node will be
performed if node appears abnormal on ultrasound.

Suspicious non mass enhancement closer to nipple in central right breast. If no US correlate to biopsy, then MR guided biopsy recommended.

CLINICAL INDICATION:  Bilateral breast MR guided biopsies January 2010, complex fibroadenomas diagnosed bilaterally.  Left surgical excision of enlarging lateral left breast mass performed April 2011 for patient comfort, which on imaging was in
keeping with a 7cm hamartoma.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGRbilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3mm slices, under 90 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Multiple prior MRI's, including 12/7/2010, 4/12/2009

FINDINGS:

There is a large volume of breast tissue bilaterally with a large amount of high intensity background parenchymal enhancement.  Bilaterally axillary breast tissue is present.  No adenopathy bilaterally.

RIGHT BREAST:

There are two right biopsy clips.  One in the upper breast centrally lying along the pectoralis muscle, which corresponds to the lesion biopsied under ultrasound, known fibroadenoma.  The other is also posterior but slightly more inferomedial, which
corresponds to the MR-guided bx, known fibroadenoma.  At the site of both clips small residual masses remain, stable or smaller in size.  No concerning enhancement in the right breast.

LEFT BREAST:
Previously visualized hamartoma in the left lateral breast has been resected since previous.  There is a collapsed postoperative seroma in the lateral breast, 2.5cm in length, nearly completely resolved.  As the mass previously looked well
encapsulated only on its superior and posterior margins, it is difficult to ensure complete surgical excision.

Clip relating to previous MRI guided bx of the medial posterior left breast is seen, no surrounding enhancement.

Non mass enhancement in the central breast remains a focal area of homogeneous non mass enhancement, asymmetric with the contralateral breast with moderate initial and persistent delayed enhancement.  It is completely isointense to parenchyma on T2.
 Morphology remains low suspicion, though the area has slightly increased in size since 2009.  If measured in the same plane, today area is 2.8 x 1.6 x 1.1cm (image 21 sagittals, image 78 axials), previously 2.1 x 1.3 x 1.1cm in 2009.  No associated
mammographic calcifications or distortion.

Immediately inferior to the focal non mass enhancement also on image 21, there is an oval mass with smooth margins, 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5cm.  Overall the lesion demonstrates moderate early and persistent delayed enhancement, benign kinetics.  The lesion
is bright on T2 with possible low intensity septations.  This appears to be new, but given interval removal of large mass (7cm), may have been previously obscured.

OPINION:
No concerning enhancement around site of three previously biopsied areas as above.

Non mass enhancement in the left central breast is slightly larger than in 2009 but has a very benign morphology and kinetic enhancement pattern and therefore maybe related to fluctuating parenchymal enhancement.  Suggest follow up in six months
with repeat MRI.

Benign appearing mass immediately inferior to the nonmass enhancement, possible fibroadenoma.  This lesion seems new, but given interval surgery, may have been obscured previously. This lesion will likely be very difficult to identify
sonographically, but second look ultrasound is suggested and as long as there are no suspicious findings in this region, then follow up MRI in six months is recommended.

FINDINGS: Both the breasts show moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild background enhancement.

Bilateral subpectoral silicone implants noted.

RIGHT BREAST: The lower inner mass in the anterior thirds (biopsied previously x 3) is again noted and appears unchanged from prior.
The 2 mildly enhancing masses in the upper inner quadrant (anterior thirds) are again noted and are unchanged from prior.

LEFT BREAST: There is a progressively enhancing mass in the upper outer quadrant (image 7) measuring 1.0cm. This was seen in the previous MR dated 30 Nov 2009 and shows minimal increase in size. It was not seen in the MR study dated Feb 2009.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes noted bilaterally.

Incidentally noted is the right lobe of the liver is a 2.5cm lobulated T2 bright enhancing mass suggestive of a hemangioma. This has been stable when compared to previous MR study.

IMPRESSION: MR findings reveal stable enhancing nodules in the right breast. There is a mass in the left upper outer quadrant (seen in Nov 2009 but not in Feb 2009).

We will call this patient for targeted ultrasound of the left upper outer quadrant and the need for ultrasound guided biopsy would be decided at that time. If ultrasound findings are negative then follow-up MRI in 6 months time is recommended.

CLINICAL INDICATION:  OBSP high risk screen. History of 2-site stereotactic biopsy upper outer left breast with biopsy results: columnar cell change with hyperplasia and focal atypia.

LMP:  Status post hysterectomy.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1
weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

COMPARISON:  MRIs including 01/11/2011. Prior mammograms including most recent from 29/06/2012.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate volume of fibroglandular tissue in the breasts bilaterally that enhances to a moderate degree with a moderate intensity, limiting the sensitivity of MRI.

New 0.8 cm area of clumped nonmass enhancement lower inner left breast without increased T2 (image 28).

New 1.0 cm nonmass enhancement upper central right breast (image 65).

1.0 cm persistent nonmass enhancement upper central right breast (image 69), probably benign, related to overall increased background enhancement.

IMPRESSION:

Background enhancement limits sensitivity. Suggest 6 month followup MRI.

Indeterminate nonmass enhancement lower inner left breast (image 28) and upper central right breast (image 65). Suggest ultrasound evaluation with view to biopsy. If no sonographic correlate, suggest MRI guided biopsy.

Probably benign nonmass enhancement upper central right breast (image 69), possibly related to overall increased background enhancement. Suggest sonographic evaluation. If no suspicious sonographic correlate, suggest 6 month followup MRI.

FINDINGS: The study is degraded by movement artefacts. There is a moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with mild degree of mild to moderate intensity background enhancement.

Corresponding with the new mammographic mass, image 15, upper inner left breast there is a lobulated 13 x 10 mm mass with rapid early and progressive delayed enhancement. Mass is bright on T2WI and has non enhancing septations. This is new but
otherwise has features of a fibroadenoma.

In addition

-image 12, post third central left breast no change 7 mm enhancing mass, T2 bright, non enhancing septations, consistent with fibroadenoma.

-image 62, posterior third, 6 mm progressively enhancing non mass enhancement at 6 o'clock right breast, no T2 signal, probably parenchymal, likely no change
-image 64, mid third lower outer right breast, 6 mm progressively enhancing non mass enhancement, no T2 signal, probably parenchymal.
-image 65, anterior third lower outer right breast, 6 mm well defined enhancing mass, T2 bright consistent with new small fibroadenoma.

-previous enhancing mass lower inner left breast no longer enhancing.
-previous enhancing mass upper outer right breast no longer enhancing.

No other findings. No evidence abnormal axillary nodes.

SUMMARY

A new enhancing mass upper inner left breast corresponds with new mammographic mass.  The MRI features suggest a new fibroadenoma and further assessment with additional left mammograms, ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided core biopsy
recommended.  These appointments will be facilitated once requisitions are faxed to the Department after a verbal report is called.  BI-RADS 4. left

HISTORY: Follow up probably benign findings from December 2009.
Lumpectomies lower inner and upper outer right breast 1985 and
2000, axillary dissection and radiation (2000) for previous
carcinoma. BRCA 2 carrier.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet with a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was
obtained through the chest. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images. Kinetic curves
were obtained. TOTAL CONTRAST: 9 CC

LMP: post menopausal

REFERENCE EXAM: previous including December 2009 mammograms and
MRI

FINDINGS: moderate amount of scattered fibroglandular tissue with
no significant background enhancement.

Distortion upper outer quadrant right breast from lumpectomy,
images 86 - 92. Just medial to the lumpectomy scar, image 82,
upper outer quadrant there is a 6 mm irregular mass with rapid
initial and plateau and washout delayed enhancement. Extending in
a somewhat ductal distribution posteriorly, image 80, there are
smaller foci of enhancement. Laterally, image 84 small area of
enhancement close to scar. Overall AP diameter 4 cm. These
findings are increasing and are suspicious for recurrence.
Mammograms from 2009 showed small calcifying oil cysts and
secretory calcifications raising the differential that this is due
to fat necrosis.

Distortion lower inner right breast from lumpectomy scarring. Tiny
area of enhancement anterior aspect unchanged and does not appear
to be significant.

Non mass enhancement upper outer left breast anterior third, image
17, is unchanged and consistent with parenchymal enhancement
increasing with time. Small stable non enhancing mass central left
breast consistent with fibroadenoma that has now calcified on the
previous mammograms.

SUMMARY: suspicious findings upper outer right breast just medial
to post lumpectomy scarring. Recurrence is suspected with the
differential including fat necrosis. Further assessment with right
mammograms with magnification views and right breast ultrasound
with view to biopsy recommended. If not seen with these modalities
then MR guided biopsy indicated.

Verbal report to be called and the appointments facilitated once
we have a requisition for the biopsies either US guided or MR
guided.

ADH. BRCA 1 positive. Stopped lactating Dec/2008. Family history
of breast cancer. High risk screening MRI. LMP May/26/2009.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was
administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3)
were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging
including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were
obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM: To previous from 2007 and 2005. Mammogram from
April/2009 are available.

FINDINGS:
There is large amount of fibroglandular tissue with no significant
background parenchymal enhancement.
In the right lower inner quadrant (image 59), there is an area of
non mass enhancement measuring approximately 13 x 12 mm with no
corresponding T2 signal. In retrospect, this was present in 2004
and unchanged.
No other suspicious focal mass, signal or enhancement in either
breast.
No abnormal lymph nodes.

OPINION:
Stable right breast non mass enhancment since 2004, most likely
parenchymal. Routine screening is recommended.

CLINICAL INDICATION: High risk screening study. BRCA 2 carrier.
LMP 2008. On HRT.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 6
dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both
breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run).
0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium (Omniscan, gadodiamide) contrast was
administered at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec scan delay. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4,
TR: 8.3) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

COMPARISON: 02.24.2009 MRI.

FINDINGS:

There is a mild amount of scattered fibroglandular tissue
throughout the breasts. There is a mild degree and intensity of
background enhancement.

In the right breast extending from six o'clock to eight o'clock,
there is an asymmetric, linear, segmental area of non-mass
enhancement (images 81-90); it measures 3.7 x 6.8 x 2.8 cm (Sag x
AP x Tx), and demonstrates a type II enhancement curve.

Stable, benign-appearing mass in the anterior one third upper
outer quadrant of the left left breast (image 18), measuring 5 mm.

No significant lymphadenopathy.

OPINION: Linear, segmental area of non-mass enhancement in the
right breast is suspicious. The patient will be called back for a
right breast ultrasound +/- biopsy. If the ultrasound is
negative, an MRI-guided biopsy is warranted.

If the patient is not contacted in two-three weeks, she should
call our department to book this appointment.

REFERENCE EXAM:  MRI of 2009

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally.  Mild to moderate degree and intensity of heterogeneous background parenchymal enhancement.

In the left breast, a lower outer quadrant between 5 to 6 o'clock position, middle to posterior third is an area of linear non-mass clumped enhancement measuring 0.8 x 3.1 by cm (SI by AP by PV).  No corresponding T2 signal.  It shows a moderate
initial enhancement with plateau on delayed phase of.  No microcalcifications seen in that area on the mammogram.

No suspicious findings right breast.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.

IMPRESSION:

Linear clumped enhancement left breast.  MRI guided the biopsy suggested this since it is unlikely that ultrasound will show an abnormality.

A verbal report will be called to the referring physician.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of 2011 and MRI of 2010

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue with a mild amount of moderate intensity stippled background parenchymal enhancement increased from previously consistent with the interval onset of estrogen replacement therapy.  No suspicious
finding is identified in the right breast.

On the left there is a new 6 mm irregular rapidly enhancing mass with delayed plateau enhancement on image 14 middle third 3 o'clock radius.  There is a small left interpectoral node but this is unchanged in size compared to the prior examination.
No other significant finding seen

OPINION: New irregular mass in the left 3 o'clock radius.  Ultrasound of the left breast and axilla with view to core biopsy if a correlate is found is suggested.  If no ultrasound correlate is present an MRI guided biopsy is recommended.
Appointment will be facilitated but requisitions are required.

REFERENCE EXAM:  10/24/2010 MRI, April 2011 Mammogram

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate volume of breast tissue bilaterally with very mild homogeneous multiregional background enhancement.

LEFT BREAST:

Known enhancing intramammary node laterally is stable (image 6).

There is a 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.4cm enhancing retroareolar mass (image 9), which is hypervascular early and demonstrates persistent plateau enhancement.  There is some central non-enhancement within this mass.  Mass is bright on T2.  Compared to previous
MRI from October 2010 it has grown slightly (0.6 x 0.2 x 0.3cm).   It is not visible on most recent mammogram of April 2011.

On the same image (9), 2cm below the nipple at 6 o'clock there is a stable, round 0.4cm probable intramammary node.

RIGHT BREAST:

There are enhancing foci in the right breast posterior third, which are questionably arranged in a linear distribution (images 58, 60, 61).  These demonstrate slow, progressive enhancement and have no associated T2 signal abnormality and are
probably parenchymal.  These are best seen on the delayed axial sequence (image 110).  No associated mammographic calcifications from most recent mammogram.

OPINION:

Right breast non mass enhancement should be followed in 6 months with repeat MRI.  BIRADS 3.

Left breast retroareolar mass is indeterminate, possible papilloma.  Given interval growth suggest correlation with MRI guided biopsy.  BIRADS 4.

FINDINGS: Both the breasts show large amount of fibroglandular tissue with moderate background enhancement.

RIGHT BREAST: Scattered T2 bright cysts noted with stippled foci of enhancement.
Image 67 shows a mildly T2 bright 1.0cm mass in the middle thirds along the nipple line. The mass is mildly vascular and shows plateau enhancement. The margins are mildly irregular.

LEFT BREAST: No suspicious enhancement noted.

No suspicious lymph nodes noted in bilateral axillary regions.

IMPRESSION: MR findings reveal a mildly enhancing mass in the right breast as described above.  Despite benign enhancement characteristics, morphology is not typically benign.  We will call this patient back for second look ultrasound of the right
breast with a view to biopsy. If the ultrasound does not show any correlate then an MR guided biopsy would be indicated. Please submit the appropriate requisitions to facilitate the same.

stable from 2007 and most in keeping with a lymph node (image 73).

No suspicious lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. No MRI evidence for malignancy. Previous left enhancement has
resolved.

2. Next bilateral mammogram is due in December 2010. We will
leave this to your office to arrange for the patient.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

CLINICAL INDICATION:  6 month follow-up of right breast lesion.  BRCA2 mutation carrier.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer,  sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(Gadovist, Gadobutrol) was administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3) were obtained through the chest. post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

LMP: January 11, 2011.

REFERENCE EXAM:  May, 2010.

FINDINGS: Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue.  No significant background parenchymal enhancement.

RIGHT BREAST: In the 6 o'clock position posterior to middle 1/3 right breast the focal area of heterogeneous non-mass enhancement is slightly enlarged now measuring 1.8 x 1.8 cm, previous 1.7 x 1.6 cm demonstrating a marked degree of rapid initial
and focal area of washout delayed enhancement.

4 mm normal-appearing intramammary lymph node upper outer quadrant posterior (image 66) unchanged.

LEFT BREAST: Unremarkable.

AXILLA: Normal.

OPINION: Slight enlargement of indeterminate non-mass enhancement right breast.  While still favored as parenchymal, given slight growth and change in enhancement characteristics biopsy is recommended.  Mammograms and breast ultrasound recommended
with view to biopsy.  If not mammographically or sonographically visible, MRI guided biopsy then recommended.

BILATERAL BREAST MRI

INDICATION: New focal asymmetry in upper outer right breast on
mammogram (July, 2010), not seen on ultrasound. Stereotactic
biopsy demonstrated benign breast tissue. This MRI study is for
further assessment.

TECHNIQUE: 1.5 T GE magnet, dedicated breast coil. Localizer,
axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest,
sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images,
sagittal T1 weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images,
simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2,
TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were
obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3 mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was
administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D VIBRANT with FS (TE:1.8,
TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including:
subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

Comparison was made to prior imaging.

FINDINGS:

There is a mild amount of breast tissue. There is a moderate
amount of mildly enhancing breast tissue.

In the right upper outer posterior breast, 9 .8 cm from the
nipple, there is a 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm spiculated mass (image 74),
which is slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging with central
hypointensity. This mass demonstrates a moderate progressive
degree of enhancement.

In the lower outer anterior right breast, there is heterogeneous
linear enhancement measuring 2.0 cm (image 77).

No suspicious findings in the left breast. No suspicious
lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION:

1. Spiculated right breast mass is suspicious. This may
represent malignancy with entrapped fat, versus a small
infiltrated lymph node vs radial scar. An MRI-guided biopsy is
warranted. BI-RADS: 5.

2. Linear heterogeneous enhancement in the right breast is
suspicious, and should be further evaluated with targeted breast
ultrasound. If this area is not identified on ultrasound,
MRI-guided biopsy is suggested. BI-RADS: 4.

If the patient is not contacted by our department in two-three
weeks, she should call our Department to arrange this appointment.

Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

LMP: December 26, 2011

REFERENCE EXAM:  Compared to prior breast imaging studies including most recent MRI dated 1/12/11.

FINDINGS:

There is a large amount of fibroglandular tissue with a moderate degree of moderate intensity stippled heterogeneous background enhancement which is overall decreased compared to prior.

Scattered enhancing foci are seen in the left breast but there is no suspicious mass or enhancement in the left breast.

Previously noted right subareolar mass is again seen on image 59 and is stable in size and appearance measuring 0.7 cm. More laterally within the inferior right breast, on image 63, there is a 0.5 cm enhancing mass which demonstrates plateau type
enhancement.  No definite T2 correlate is identified. It is not definitely seen on 2009 or 2010 MRIs.

There is also a posterior progressively enhancing mass measuring 0.5 cm within the medial right breast (image 55) which is stable since 2009 and likely benign.

There is a new 0.6 cm enhancing nodule adjacent to the sternum (sagittal image 42) in keeping with a probable internal mammary chain lymph node. There is also a prominent right axillary node measuring 0.7 cm in short axis and is similar in
appearance to prior MR (axial image 26).

IMPRESSION:
1. Indeterminate right lower outer quadrant mass (image 63) with plateau type enhancement. Recommend second look ultrasound with view to biopsy. If not seen sonographically, MRI guided biopsy is recommended. (BIRADS 4)
2. Probable right internal mammary node.  Recommend correlation with ultrasound.
3. Prominent right axillary node which appears stable since January 2011.  Recommend correlation with targeted ultrasound.
4. Stable right retroareolar mass is unchanged since 2009 in keeping with benign etiology. (BIRADS 2)

CLINICAL INDICATION: Bilateral nipple discharge with prior excision of papillomas bilaterally  LMP 2003

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 83, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted  3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous
sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.4, TR:7.0) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2, under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv
gadolinium contrast (6 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram and ultrasound of 2012 and MRIs of 2011 and 2010.

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue with a moderate amount of marked intensity stippled background parenchymal enhancement bilaterally.  There are small cysts bilaterally.  There is post operative distortion in the subareolar regions.
 On image 70 in the right 6 o'clock position anteriorly there is a 1.1 cm elongated heterogeneously enhancing mass which likely corresponds to the intraductal mass identified on ultrasound and ductography.  No lymphadenopathy seen.

OPINION: There are multiple foci of enhancement and the possibility of small papillary lesions cannot be excluded.  MRI correlate is seen to the intraductal lesion seen on ductography and ultrasound in the right subareolar region. Ultrasound guided
biopsy of this has been previously recommended.  However no other significant change.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of 2010.  No prior MRI

FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense with a moderate amount of moderate intensity stippled and focal parenchymal enhancement bilaterally.  Patient is not optimally timed to her menstrual cycle.  There are cysts bilaterally.

No suspicious enhancement in the left breast.  In the right 6 o'clock position middle third there is a 5 mm lobular mass showing rapid early and delayed washout enhancement with no associated T2 signal.  No definitely abnormal axillary nodes are
seen.

OPINION: Examination is limited by the degree of background parenchymal enhancement.  Targeted ultrasound is suggested to look for a correlate the 5 mm mass in the 6 o'clock position of the right breast to biopsy.   If it is not identified on
ultrasound an MRI guided vacuum assisted biopsy is recommended.  Requisitions for these examinations are required.

REFERENCE EXAM:  MRI of March 2011

FINDINGS:

Moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally.  Interval surgery for bilateral sub glandular implants.  Moderate degree and intensity of diffuse stippled and heterogeneous background of parenchymal enhancement, overall decreased compared to
previous.

The previously described segmental enhancement left breast at 3 o'clock is not seen on current examination.  Stable mass lower inner quadrant of the left breast measuring 11 x 3 mm immediately anterior to the implant.  The previously described
irregular non-mass enhancement in the upper inner quadrant is not seen.

Stable right upper outer quadrant non-mass enhancement, close to the axillary tail measuring 32 x 15 mm, unchanged (image 76).

New round mass measuring 7.4 mm in the right upper outer quadrant (image 78) which shows rapid initial enhancement with washout.  This is slightly hyperintense on T2.  This is not seen on the mammogram or previous MRI but comparison with previous is
difficult as the tissue has been displaced.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes.

IMPRESSION:

Interval new bilateral breast implants.

Decreased in the background of parenchymal enhancement in the previously described enhancement in both breasts.

Questionable new mass upper outer quadrant for which targeted ultrasound suggested that.  If not seen on ultrasound, suggest MRI guided biopsy because the is difficult to compare with the previous where there was no implant.  (BI-RADS 4)

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet with a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:8.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal
T1 weighted fat saturated 3D FSPGR images (TE:3.7, TR:8.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3mm slices ZIP 2, under 2 min/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast (Gadovist,
Gadobutrol) was administered by bolus injection. Axial VIBRANT (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was obtained through the chest. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP and 3D reformatted MIP images. Kinetic curves were obtained. TOTAL CONTRAST: 8.5 CC
Gadovist

LMP: April 29, 2012

REFERENCE EXAM: previous including mammograms December 2011 and MRI March 2011

FINDINGS: moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with moderate to marked degree of moderate intensity stippled and heterogeneous background enhancement.

Biopsy clip artefact upper outer left breast posterior third. 9 mm lateral to the clip there is an irregular enhancing mass the target of the 2010 MR biopsy. This is difficult to measure but is at least 7 mm. This appears marginally larger and was
not present in 2008. There is rapid initial and delayed plateau with some washout enhancement.

Biopsy clip artefact upper outer right breast. No suspicious enhancement right breast.

No abnormal appearing lymph nodes.

Question of consolidation medial right base. Chest xray obtained following contrast reaction.

SUMMARY: The previously biopsied enhancing mass deep in the upper outer left breast may be marginally larger. Further assessment with repeat mammograms, ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided biopsy recommended. This appointment will be
facilitated.  If no findings then follow up MRI in six months should be considered.  (depends on details of contrast reaction)

No suspicious enhancement around biopsy clip upper outer right breast.

Prominent background enhancement but unchanged. BI-RADS 3.

Question of consolidation medial right lung base. Follow up chest xray recommended.


PLEASE NOTE PATIENT HAD CONTRAST REACTION TO GADOLINIUM AND WAS SENT TO EMERGENCY BY THE TECHNOLOGIST. We will need more details before any more MRI studies are booked.

gadolinium contrast (5.3 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  MRI April 14, 2012 and mammogram December 11, 2012

LMP: Spotting December 2012, last full period August 2012.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate to large amount of fibroglandular tissue with a mild amount of mild intensity background parenchymal enhancement.

LEFT BREAST:
Within the left upper inner breast there is a small mass that demonstrates early enhancement that persists measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm (image 22) with mild associated T2 signal similar to background parenchyma.  This was present on the previous
study from April 14, 2012 (image 24) but appears more prominent and slightly larger on the current study and was not seen on studies prior to April 14, 2012.  No other suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement in the left breast.

RIGHT BREAST:
There are several foci of progressive enhancement in the right breast on images 65, 67 and 70 that were seen on the previous studies dating back to March 2011.  These likely represent background parenchymal enhancement.  No suspicious mass or
non-mass enhancement in the right breast.

No evidence of axillary lymphadenopathy bilaterally.

OPINION:

Small mass in the left upper inner breast that is slightly larger on the current study than on April 24, 2012 when it appeared as a focus, not present on studies prior to April 24, 2012.  Further assessment with second look ultrasound is recommended
with view to biopsy.  If a sonographic correlate cannot be identified, MRI guided biopsy is recommended.  This appointment will be facilitated.

CLINICAL INDICATION:  High risk screening.

LMP:  Post menopausal. HRT x 6 months.

TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a dedicated breast coil. Localizer, axial T1 weighted FSPGR images (TE:4.2, TR:150) through the chest, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE: 88, TR:3000) fat saturated images, sagittal T1
weighted FSPGR (TE:4.2, TR:9) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1 weighted fat saturated images (TE:3.2, TR:6.6) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (108, 3mm slices, under 90
sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mm/kg of iv gadolinium contrast was administered by bolus injection. Axial 3D FAME with FS (TE:1.8, TR: 7.8) were then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

COMPARISON:  No prior MRI. Prior mammograms including most recent from 03/10/2011.

FINDINGS:

There is a moderate volume of fibroglandular tissue in the breasts bilaterally that enhances to a moderate degree with a moderate intensity, limiting the sensitivity of MRI.

Ovoid 1.5 x 0.8 x1.2 cm mass left lower central breast.  The periphery of the mass demonstrates progressive enhancement and increased T2 signal.  The central component of the mass is relatively hypoenhancing with decreased T2 signal.

No suspicious enhancement in the right breast.

Prominent left axillary lymph nodes (image 80 and 85, series 5). Suggest ultrasound evaluation of the left axilla.

Incompletely characterized lesions in the right hepatic lobe measuring  0.9 cm and 0.5 cm likely represent cysts (series 5, image 41 and 17). Suggest ultrasound for further evaluation.

Please note low to intermediate grade DCIS may not be depicted on MRI.

IMPRESSION:

Indeterminate mass left lower central breast. Suggest second look ultrasound with view to biopsy. If no sonographic correlate, suggest MRI guided biopsy.

Prominent left axillary lymph nodes. Suggest sonographic evaluation of the left axilla and possible lymph node fine needle aspiration, if indicated.

Please submit a requisition for biopsies. A verbal report will be called to the referring physician. If the report for the diagnostic workup is not received in the next 3 to 4 weeks, please contact the breast imaging department.

Incompletely characterized hepatic lesions, likely cysts. Suggest ultrasound for further evaluation.

REFERENCE EXAM:  MRI of March 2010 and ultrasound of January thousand and 11

FINDINGS:

Large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally with moderate degree and intensity of background parenchymal enhancement.

Again seen are multiple bilateral cysts, the largest one in the right breast at 9 o'clock measuring 5 x 3 cm. It corresponds to to the cyst seen on ultrasound with the mural mass.    It originates from the posterior wall of the cyst and measures
approximately 8 mm.  It is not from the dependent portion of the cyst and therefore it is unlikely to be debris.  It shows moderate rim enhancement with delayed washout.

The previously biopsied right multiseptated cyst has decreased in size.  A clip is seen within the cyst.

No suspicious axillary lymph nodes or other enhancement in either breast.

IMPRESSION:

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral mammogram 11/29/2010

FINDINGS:

Large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Moderate
degree in density or background parenchymal enhancement.

In the left breast, extending from the subareolar region,
extending superiorly, inferiorly and medially is a lobulated
irregular area of enhancement with some areas showing rim
enhancement with washout. This measures approximately 4.6 by 2.2
by 2 cm (SI by AP by TV. No corresponding T2 signal. Some of the
enhancement corresponds to the area of microcalcifications seen on
the mammogram particularly in the upper outer quadrant.

The right breast has a similar appearance and measures 6 by 2.4 by
2 cm. Some of the areas of enhancement again corresponds to the
area of microcalcifications seen on the mammogram. The most
suspicious areas of enhancement is in the subareolar region
extending inferiorly toward 6 o'clock and laterally towards 9
o'clock. Some of the suspicious areas and enhancement correspond
to the area of microcalcifications in the upper outer quadrant of
the right breast.
IMPRESSION:

Bilateral suspicious areas of enhancement which implies a
significant portion of the breasts bilaterally. Bilateral
targeted ultrasound suggested to the area of abnormalities
described on the MRI with view to biopsy and exclude the diagnosis
of invasive disease since a diagnosis ADH were obtained
bilaterally of the microcalcifications.

If the ultrasound is negative, consideration should be given to
MRI guided biopsy of both breasts, on the left in the subareolar
region of one of the enhancing masses and on the right also
subareolar of one of the rim enhancing masses again.

REFERENCE EXAM: Bilateral mammogram 11/29/2010

FINDINGS:

Large amount of fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. Moderate
degree in density or background parenchymal enhancement.

In the left breast, extending from the subareolar region,
extending superiorly, inferiorly and medially is a lobulated
irregular area of enhancement with some areas showing rim
enhancement with washout. This measures approximately 4.6 by 2.2
by 2 cm (SI by AP by TV. No corresponding T2 signal. Some of the
enhancement corresponds to the area of microcalcifications seen on
the mammogram particularly in the upper outer quadrant.

The right breast has a similar appearance and measures 6 by 2.4 by
2 cm. Some of the areas of enhancement again corresponds to the
area of microcalcifications seen on the mammogram. The most
suspicious areas of enhancement is in the subareolar region
extending inferiorly toward 6 o'clock and laterally towards 9
o'clock. Some of the suspicious areas and enhancement correspond
to the area of microcalcifications in the upper outer quadrant of
the right breast.
IMPRESSION:

Bilateral suspicious areas of enhancement which implies a
significant portion of the breasts bilaterally. Bilateral
targeted ultrasound suggested to the area of abnormalities
described on the MRI with view to biopsy and exclude the diagnosis
of invasive disease since a diagnosis ADH were obtained
bilaterally of the microcalcifications.

If the ultrasound is negative, consideration should be given to
MRI guided biopsy of both breasts, on the left in the subareolar
region of one of the enhancing masses and on the right also
subareolar of one of the rim enhancing masses again.


BI-RADS: 5 both breasts

REFERENCE EXAM:  previous breast imaging including MRI January 2012 and mammograms June 2012.

FINDINGS: moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with moderate amount of moderate intensity background enhancement increased since previous studies. Subglandular silicone implant integrity cannot be assessed with these sequences.

In the upper outer left breast, images 13-19, there are patchy areas of non mass enhancement unchanged since 2008. There are no suspicious areas of enhancement. The previously described findings are likely parenchymal and are unchanged. This
includes the gradually enhancing 6 mm area upper outer left breast, image 13.

In the upper outer right breast, image 83, anterior third, there is a 10 mm superficial new area of non mass enhancement.  There is rapid initial with delayed progressive enhancement.

Previously described enhancement in the lateral right breast is seen but appears to be part of the parenchymal enhancement.

No abnormal appearing lymph nodes.

SUMMARY: New area of non mass enhancement upper outer right breast. Ultrasound with view to possible biopsy recommended and this appointment will be facilitated. This may be parenchymal since generally there is increased parenchymal enhancement as
the study was not timed to the cycle. If no ultrasound correlate then follow up MRI in six months (timed to cycle) recommended.

CLINICAL INDICATION:  OBSP High risk screen. IBIS 30.88%.

TECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T GE magnet, using a
dedicated breast coil. Localizer, sagittal T2 weighted FSE (TE:
76, TR:2500) fat saturated images, sagittal T1 weighted 3D FSPGR
(TE:4.2, TR:7.2) bilateral images, simultaneous sagittal T1
weighted fat saturated images fat saturated 3D FSPGR images
(TE:3.7, TR:7.4) pre and 4 dynamic runs post gadolinium contrast
were obtained of both breasts using VIBRANT (3 mm slices ZIP 2,
under 120 sec/dynamic run). 0.1 mmol/kg of iv gadolinium contrast
(5.3 cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay.
Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing
imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP
images were obtained.

LMP: June 1, 2012

REFERENCE EXAM:  Compared to previous breast imaging studies

FINDINGS:

The breasts contain a large amount of fibroglandular tissue with marked degree/intensity stippled heterogeneous background enhancement which can limit sensitivity of breast MRI.

There is a stable 7.7 x 4.8 cm fat containing mass in the central posterior left breast which is most in keeping with a hamartoma.

Within the medial left breast, there is new focal non mass enhancement measuring 0 .9 x 0 .6 cm (image 22) .    The enhancement pattern in gradual and progressive. Superior and lateral to this, on images 20 and 21, there is a 4.1 x 2.8 cm region of
non-mass enhancement which is also gradual and progressive.  It appears to have been present on the prior MRI but is increased in prominence.

Stable appearance of possible right breast hamartoma (image 70).  No suspicious mass or enhancement in the right breast.

No adenopathy.

IMPRESSION:

1. New and increasing non-mass enhancement in the left medial breast. Recommend second look targeted ultrasound.  If no sonographic correlate is seen, recommend MRI guided biopsies of both areas.
2. Stable appearance probable bilateral breast hamartomas.

A verbal report will be called.

LMP: July 16, 2011

REFERENCE EXAM: mammograms and ultrasound July 2011

FINDINGS: moderate amount of fibroglandular tissue with moderate degree and intensity background enhancement.

In the left subareolar region 9 o'clock, images 15-17, there is a 15 x 9 mm well defined bilobed enhancing mass. This shows rapid initial and mixed delayed progressive and plateau kinetics. This is moderately hyperintense on T2WI.  This is a
probable fibroadenoma and likely corresponds to the bilobed ultrasound finding at 12 o'clock. Although on ultrasound that was felt to be a possible intraductal lesion there is no evidence of an intraductal mass in the left subareolar region.

In the medial right breast, image 78, at 3 o'clock is a superficial 16 x 10 mm well defined mass that is minimally enhancing and considered to be benign. This likely corresponds to the mass described in 2000.

In the lower outer right breast, image 86, there is a 7 mm well defined superficial lobulated enhancing mass. This shows slow initial with delayed progressive enhancement and is very likely benign. This may correspond with the ultrasound finding
that is recommended for biopsy.

In the superior central right breast, image 78, there is a 6 mm well defined lobulated mass, with no T2 signal. This shows rapid initial with delayed plateau enhancement. This is likely benign.

No abnormal appearing nodes.

SUMMARY:

No suspicious findings. US guided biopsy has been recommended to assess an abnormality at 7 o'clock right breast and this may correspond to a probably benign MR finding image 86. Since not all the MR findings had ultrasound correlates and there is
significant background enhancement, follow up MR in six months recommended.

REFERENCE EXAM:  MRI 1/12/2011

FINDINGS:

LEFT BREAST:
Previously seen mass at the 9 o'clock position of the left breast has been removed.  There is mild post-surgical enhancement at the lumpectomy site in the left medial breast with evidence of fat necrosis.

In the left subareolar breast, image 19 immediately lateral to the nipple, there is a focal area of hypervascular, linear heterogeneous enhancement.  No associated T2 signal abnormality.  This enhancement is along the anterior and inferior margin of
the previously described non-mass enhancement on MRI from approximately one year ago (though the remaining larger area of non-mass enhancement has resolved).  The clip from previous stereotactic core biopsy is posterior and medial to this
enhancement.

Previously described lobulated masses in the lateral breast:
1)lower outer quadrant is smaller (0.7 x 0.3cm, prev 0.8 x 0.4cm), remains bright on T2
2)upper outer quadrant is not seen today, in retrospect may have been parenchymal

RIGHT BREAST:  No concerning enhancement in the right breast.  Very minimal distortion related to previous surgical excision.

NODES/AXILLA:  No significant adenopathy or ancillary finding.

OPINION:

Interval removal of left breast mass medially with post surgical change.

Left subareolar breast, slightly lateral to the nipple, residual area of indeterminate enhancement which will require correlation with biopsy.  Given that the patient had prior stereotactic core biopsy of calcifications nearby (with clip visualized
posteromedial to this enhancement), would suggest direct correlation with MRI guided biopsy.  BIRADS 4b.

No MR evidence of malignancy in the right breast.  BIRADS 2.

cc)was administered by injection at 2 cc/sec, 20 sec delay. Axial Vibrant (TE:4, TR: 8.3) was then obtained. Post processing imaging including: subtraction and MIP \T\ 3D reformatted MIP images were obtained.

REFERENCE EXAM:  Mammogram of 2013 and MRIs of 2012 and 2010

FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue with a moderate amount of moderate intensity diffuse background parenchymal enhancement.  There are small cysts bilaterally.  Previously described mass in the right 12 o'clock position posteriorly
is no longer in evident.

In the left breast superior and medial to the nipple line image 22 there is a 6 millimeter heterogeneously enhancing nodule with increased T2 signal which was not previously evident and has rapid early and progressive delayed enhancement.  This is
posterior and slightly lateral to a cluster of microcysts.

No other significant finding.

OPINION: Further evaluation of the small mass in the left breast with ultrasound with view to biopsy is suggested.  If it is not identified on ultrasound an MRI guided biopsy is suggested.
